<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Openness to experience-the enjoyment of novel experiences and ideas-has many connections to cognitive processes. People high in openness to experience, for example, tend to be more creative and have broader general knowledge than people low in openness to experience. In the current study, we use a network science approach to examine if the organization of semantic memory differs between high and low groups of openness to experience. A sample of 516 adults completed measures of openness to experience (from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 and Big Five Aspect Scales) and a semantic verbal fluency task. Next, the sample was split into half to form high (n = 258) and low (n = 258) openness to experience groups. Semantic networks were then constructed on the basis of their verbal fluency responses. Our results revealed that the high openness to experience group's network was more interconnected, flexible, and had better local organization of associations than the low openness to experience group. We also found that the high openness to experience group generated more responses on average and provided more unique responses than the low openness to experience group. Taken together, our results indicate that openness to experience is related to semantic memory structure. © 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology</p></div>

Thus, people high in openness to experience actively attain information that contributes to general knowledge and semantic knowledge, more specifically.</p><p>To date, a handful of studies have implied a link between openness to experience and semantic memory.

Finally, openness to experience is a consistent predictor of performance on semantic verbal fluency tasks-generating as many responses as possible for a single category-which taps the ability to recall semantic information stored in long-term memory (e.g. animals; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,87.76,737.37,80.51,8.80" target="#b77">Sutin et al., 2011)</ref>. Given the aforementioned evidence, people high in openness to experience might differ from people low in openness to experience in how they recall and use semantic information. Thus, investigating the structure of their semantic memory via semantic networks may offer a way to investigate these differences.</p></div>

For this study, we constructed our semantic networks using a verbal fluency task (i.e. the animals category). While different semantic categories have been used for this task, the animal category is the most widely used, as it has a universal taxonomy (i.e. the animal kingdom) and has shown only minor differences across different languages and cultures <ref type="bibr" coords="2,447.37,581.40,107.60,8.80;2,313.00,593.36,53.30,8.80" target="#b4">(Ardila, Ostrosky-Solís, &amp; Bernal, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SEMANTIC NETWORK TERMINOLOGY</head><p>Of the network models that have been developed in network science theory, the small world network model <ref type="bibr" coords="2,516.36,665.37,38.60,8.80;2,313.00,677.38,61.55,8.80" target="#b81">(Watts &amp; Strogatz, 1998)</ref> has been one of the most widely used to examine complex systems. Small world networks are defined by two main characteristics: the network's clustering coefficient (CC) and its average shortest path length (ASPL). The CC of a node refers to the extent that two neighbours of a node will themselves be neighbours (i.e. a neighbour is a node i that is connected through an edge to node j). In this way, the average clustering of the nodes in the network (referred to hereafter as CC) indicates how semantic information is organized at a local level (e.g. marine animals). A network with a higher CC suggests that exemplars that are near-neighbours to each other (e.g. fish-dolphin-whaleshark) tend to co-occur. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,215.15,113.40,67.11,8.80;3,40.25,125.36,26.52,8.80" target="#b10">Borodkin et al. (2016)</ref> have shown how the CC of the second language in bilinguals is higher, attributed to less organized semantic networks compared with the organization of the semantic network of their first language.</p><p>The ASPL refers to the average shortest number of steps (i.e. edges) needed to traverse between any pair of nodes. In semantic networks, short path lengths indicate increased interconnectivity and smaller distances between concepts, which may relate to a greater ability to switch from one sub-category to another, with fewer mediating associations (e.g. cat-fish-dolphin compared with cat-dog-fish-whaledolphin). According to the Adaptive Control of Thought (ACT) model, lower ASPL might affect spreading activation-the activation of associations between concepts-and facilitate the search and retrieval of associations in memory <ref type="bibr" coords="3,40.25,305.36,71.40,8.80" target="#b3">(Anderson, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,115.94,305.36,98.99,8.80" target="#b16">Collins &amp; Loftus, 1975)</ref>. In this regard, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,40.25,317.38,164.43,8.80" target="#b45">Kenett, Levi, Anaki, and Faust (2017)</ref> have shown how shorter distances in a semantic network predict behavioural performance in a relatedness judgement task. Furthermore, higher creative ability has been related to lower ASPL <ref type="bibr" coords="3,40.25,365.40,93.18,8.80" target="#b7">(Benedek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,137.82,365.40,80.17,8.80" target="#b40">Kenett et al., 2014)</ref>. These studies have argued that the lower ASPL in the semantic network of high creative individuals may have contributed to their ability to generate more unique responses to target words than the less creative group .</p><p>The final network measure, commonly used to quantify semantic networks, is modularity. Modularity identifies how a network breaks apart (or partitions) into smaller subnetworks or communities <ref type="bibr" coords="3,160.16,461.38,75.37,8.80" target="#b28">(Fortunato, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,243.89,461.38,38.40,8.80;3,40.25,473.40,21.49,8.80" target="#b63">Newman, 2006)</ref>. The modularity statistic (Q) measures the extent to which the network has dense connections between nodes within a community and sparse (or few) connections between nodes in different communities. Thus, a network with a large Q would have more neatly compartmentalized (or more rigidly defined) communities in the network compared with a network with a small Q. In a semantic network, these communities might represent sub-categories of a larger category. The animal category, for example, might have sub-categories of pets, reptiles, insects, and marine animals <ref type="bibr" coords="3,40.25,593.37,79.83,8.80" target="#b29">(Goñi et al., 2011)</ref>.

For example, the semantic network of individuals with high functioning autism (Asperger's syndrome) exhibits a higher modularity value than matched controls, which is attributed to their rigidity in processing creative language <ref type="bibr" coords="3,40.25,677.39,107.15,8.80" target="#b43">(Kenett, Gold, et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE PRESENT STUDY</head><p>Given the evidence presented previously, it seems that openness to experience might be related to semantic memory, which may facilitate the relationship between the trait and cognitive abilities. Our study is the first network analysis on the relation of openness to experience and semantic memory structure. We assessed openness to experience using two different inventories, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 (NEO-FFI-3; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,360.91,113.40,98.45,8.80" target="#b54">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2007)</ref> and Big Five Aspect Scales (BFAS; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,372.53,125.37,157.16,8.80" target="#b19">DeYoung, Quilty, &amp; Peterson, 2007)</ref>, to capture a broad, comprehensive measurement of the trait. We then divided the sample in half to form groups of high and low openness to experience. Previous studies, using a similar semantic network approach, have found that highly creative people tend to have semantic network structures that are more interconnected (low ASPL) and flexible (low Q; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,305.29,209.39,90.85,8.80" target="#b7">Benedek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,400.88,209.39,82.40,8.80" target="#b40">Kenett et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,488.01,209.39,59.22,8.80;3,305.29,221.40,49.02,8.80" target="#b42">Kenett, Beaty, et al., 2016)</ref> than less creative people. Because of openness to experience's relationship with creativity, we predicted that the high openness to experience group's semantic network would exhibit similar network properties, namely, a lower ASPL and Q. Finally, because more efficient search and retrieval processes are supported by the structure of a small world network (i.e. a large CC and a small ASPL; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,507.01,293.40,40.27,8.80;3,305.29,305.36,60.84,8.80" target="#b51">Marupaka &amp; Minai, 2011)</ref>, we anticipated that the CC would be higher for the high openness to experience group than the low openness to experience.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>There were 516 participants in the current study who were included across three samples. The first sample was collected during the Fall 2015 semester through the University of North Carolina at Greensboro's (UNCG) psychology research pool as part of a broader research project. The total sample included 311 participants and was based on a power analysis on a desired sample size of 300, given that project's primary aims. A total of 56 participants were excluded because of missing verbal fluency data, 41 because of inattentive responding, and 8 because of being non-native English speakers. The remaining sample consisted of 206 participants (54.9% Caucasian, 36.8% African American) who were primarily young adults (M = 19.16, SD = 3.33, 78.6% female, 15% male) enrolled in psychology courses.

Sample size was predetermined for the first author's thesis, which required at least 200 people. Data collection ended after the Spring 2017 semester concluded. A total of 262 participants were recruited using the university's psychology research pool, of which 60 participants were excluded because of missing fluency data, 21 because of inattentive responding, and 8 because of being non-native English speakers. The remaining sample consisted of 173 participants (53.2% Caucasian, 45.1% African American) who were primarily young adults (M = 18.61, SD = 1.10, 78.6% female, 20.2% male) and were enrolled in psychology courses. Participants were compensated with research credits for their participation in the study. The third sample (N = 168) was obtained from a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study . Sample size was predetermined on the basis of a grant proposal, with recruitment ending after 2 years upon project start (Summer 2015-Summer 2017). Participants were recruited from UNCG and its surrounding community using fliers around campus and local ads describing an fMRI study on creativity. This study had several common exclusion and inclusion criteria for neuroimaging research: participants must be right handed, have no past psychiatric disorder, and cannot currently be taking any medication. Participants were excluded if any of these restrictions were met or if they were unable to complete the neuroimaging procedures (e.g. unremovable piercings and claustrophobia). Five participants were excluded because of inattentive responding, 8 because of missing data, and 18 because of being non-native English speakers. The final sample consisted of 137 participants (71.5% Caucasian, 27% African American) who were primarily young adults (M = 22.73, SD = 6.42, 73% female). This sample specifically oversampled art, music, and science majors to increase the sample's population of creative domains. Participants were compensated with $100 for completion of the study.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Behavioural analyses Total number of responses. Pearson's correlation was used to examine the relation between the total number of responses given by each participant and the latent variable of openness to experience. For the groups, a t-test was used to determine whether one group produced more responses, on average, than the other. A greater number of total responses might suggest a greater depth of knowledge for the animal category. Unique number of responses. To examine whether there was difference in the number of unique responses generated (i.e. responses generated by only one group), McNemar's chi-squared test was used <ref type="bibr" coords="5,159.70,592.40,62.76,8.80" target="#b2">(Agresti, 2003)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network analysis</head><p>Semantic network construction. The semantic fluency data of the two openness to experience groups were analysed using a semantic network approach developed to analyse semantic fluency data <ref type="bibr" coords="5,145.19,737.37,94.23,8.80" target="#b47">(Kenett et al., 2013)</ref>. In this approach, each node represents a category exemplar (e.g. frog) and edges represent associations between two exemplars. These associations are the tendency of the sample to generate exemplar b (e.g. toad) when they have also generated exemplar a (e.g. frog).</p><p>The networks were constructed in the following way. First, the cleaned responses were separated into their respective group of openness to experience. Then, as in previous studies, all unique animal responses were matched between the groups, and only responses generated by two or more participants in both groups were included <ref type="bibr" coords="5,488.18,161.36,59.07,8.80;5,305.29,173.38,22.70,8.80" target="#b47">(Kenett et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,330.75,173.38,106.25,8.80" target="#b42">Kenett, Beaty, et al., 2016)</ref>. This criterion allows a direct comparison between the networks because they are constructed of the same nodes, thus controlling for confounding factors (e.g. differences in nodes or edges; <ref type="bibr" coords="5,497.94,209.38,49.34,8.80;5,305.29,221.40,158.03,8.80" target="#b13">Christensen, Kenett, Aste, Silvia, &amp; Kwapil, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,467.49,221.40,79.76,8.80;5,305.29,233.36,81.76,8.80" target="#b77">van Wijk, Stam, &amp; Daffertshofer, 2010)</ref>. These data matrices were structured so that each row contained all responses generated by one participant and each column was a category exemplar (i.e. an animal).</p><p>Next, we calculated the word association matrix from the data matrices using the cosine similarity. The cosine similarity is commonly used in LSA <ref type="bibr" coords="5,431.38,305.37,115.86,8.80" target="#b49">(Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997)</ref> and is related to Pearson's correlation, which can be considered as the cosine between two normalized vectors. Below, we present the formula used to compute the cosine similarity:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="5,371.23,363.93,176.02,32.15">cos ¼ ∑ n i¼1 A i B i ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ∑ n i¼1 A 2 i q ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ∑ n i¼1 B 2 i q ;<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where A i represents the column vector of response a and B i represents the column vector of response b. Unlike Pearson's correlation, the cosine similarity ranges from 0 to 1 because it is based on the co-occurrence of responses. If two responses do not co-occur, then the cosine similarity is 0. Therefore, associations are all positively valued, which has the advantage of not assuming that the lack of co-occurrence suggests a negative association between two responses (whereas Pearson's correlation carries that potential). The response of dog, for example, occurred the most in the sample, so any response that is infrequent and does not co-occur frequently is likely to have a negative association (e.g. dog-Siberian Husky, r = À0.141, p = 0.001; even though Siberian Husky is a breed of a dog). The word similarity matrix is examined as an n × n adjacency matrix of a weighted, undirected network, where each word represents a node (n i ) in the network and the edges between two nodes represent the similarity between them. Most of the edges will have small values or weak associations, which represent noise in the network. To minimize the noise and possible spurious associations, we applied the triangulated maximally filtered graph (TMFG; <ref type="bibr" coords="5,466.02,665.36,81.21,8.80;5,305.29,677.38,47.32,8.80" target="#b13">Christensen, Kenett, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,355.30,677.38,139.19,8.80" target="#b52">Massara, Di Matteo, &amp; Aste, 2016)</ref>. The TMFG constructs a sub-network, capturing the most relevant information (i.e. removal of spurious connections and retaining high correlations) within the original network <ref type="bibr" coords="5,515.17,713.38,32.04,8.80;5,305.29,725.40,144.12,8.80" target="#b44">(Kenett, Kenett, Ben-Jacob, &amp; Faust, 2011)</ref>. This approach retains the same number of edges between the groups, which avoids the confound of different network structures being due to a different number of edges <ref type="bibr" coords="6,73.36,65.38,85.27,8.80" target="#b77">van Wijk et al., 2010)</ref>. Thus, the networks constructed by this approach can be directly compared because they have an equivalent number of nodes and edges. The TMFG method was applied using the NetworkToolbox package <ref type="bibr" coords="6,48.02,113.40,78.78,8.80" target="#b11">(Christensen, 2018)</ref> in R.</p><p>To examine the structure of the networks, the edges are binarized so that all edges are converted to a uniform weight (i.e. 1). Although the networks could be analysed using weighted edges (weights equivalent to the correlation strength), this potentially adds noise to the interpretation of the structure of the network. Moreover, <ref type="bibr" coords="6,210.79,185.40,79.11,8.80;6,48.02,197.36,80.07,8.80" target="#b0">Abbott, Austerweil, and Griffiths (2015)</ref> show that weighted and unweighted semantic networks produce similar results. Thus, the networks are analysed as unweighted (all weights are treated as equal) and undirected (bidirectional relations between nodes) networks.</p><p>Network analysis. All network measures-CC, ASPL, and Q-were calculated with the NetworkToolbox package. To statistically examine the validity of our findings, we applied two complementary approaches. The first approach, simulation of random networks for each openness to experience group, statistically tested whether the network parameters did not result from a null hypothesis of a random network. To this end, we generated a large sample of Erdös-Rényi random networks with a fixed edge probability <ref type="bibr" coords="6,96.21,376.40,96.04,8.80" target="#b22">(Erdös &amp; Rényi, 1960)</ref>. Because all networks had the same number of nodes and edges, we simulated a distribution of random networks and compared the empirical network measures of both groups to this random distribution. For each simulated random network, we computed its CC, ASPL, and Q. This procedure was simulated with 1000 realizations and resulted in a random reference distribution for each measure. The empirical network measures were then compared with their reference distribution to evaluate its statistical significance. This was achieved via a one-sample Z-test for each network parameter.</p><p>Second, we used a bootstrapping approach <ref type="bibr" coords="6,235.73,508.38,54.23,8.80" target="#b20">(Efron, 1979)</ref> to simulate and compare partial semantic networks for both groups. On the basis of previous studies <ref type="bibr" coords="6,221.45,532.36,68.54,8.80;6,48.02,544.38,22.70,8.80" target="#b10">(Borodkin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,74.21,544.38,109.08,8.80" target="#b42">Kenett, Beaty, et al., 2016)</ref>, the bootstrapping procedure involved random selection of half of the nodes of the semantic network. Partial semantic networks were constructed for each group separately for these random nodes. This method is known as without replacement bootstrapping <ref type="bibr" coords="6,48.02,604.37,57.74,8.80" target="#b8">(Bertail, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,108.34,604.37,99.58,8.80" target="#b65">Politis &amp; Romano, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,210.45,604.37,46.44,8.80" target="#b72">Shao, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, any differences between the two networks should be due to differences in the groups rather than differences in nodes or edges. This approach makes it possible to generate many simulated partial semantic networks, allowing for statistical examination of the difference between any two networks. To better examine the reliability of this approach, following the procedure of <ref type="bibr" coords="6,160.67,688.39,129.27,8.80;6,48.02,700.40,24.81,8.80" target="#b21">Epskamp, Borsboom, and Fried (2018)</ref>, we also generated graded partial semantic networks for both groups that involved 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% of the nodes. For each partial network and for each group, the CC, ASPL, and Q measures were computed. This procedure was estimated with 1000 realizations for each of the graded partial bootstrapping analyses. This bootstrapped approach was computed, and its corresponding figures were generated using the SemNetToolbox package in R.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The present study is the first to examine the relationship between semantic network structure and openness to experience. People higher in openness to experience came up with a greater total number of responses on average and produced more unique responses. The semantic network analyses revealed that the semantic network of the high openness to experience group exhibited better local organization of associations (higher CC) and was more interconnected (lower ASPL) and flexible (lower Q) compared with the semantic network of the low openness to experience group. Our bootstrapped partial network analyses corroborated these results, suggesting the relationship between openness to experience and the structure of semantic knowledge appears to be robust. The findings suggest that semantic knowledge is represented differently in highly open people, which may facilitate their ability to reach more remote associations and in turn be more creative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Semantic networks and openness to experience</head><p>The network analysis of the full networks revealed that the network of the high openness to experience group had smaller ASPL and Q values and a larger CC value. These results are in line with our predictions. In general, these findings suggest that the high openness to experience group's semantic network had more efficient retrieval of associations, meaning their ability to generate responses via clustering (high CC) and switching (low ASPL) processes was superior to the low openness to experience group. Moreover, the high openness to experience group's network structure had a smaller Q, suggesting their associations were less rigid than the low openness to experience group. These findings are similar to semantic networks related to creative ability <ref type="bibr" coords="9,40.25,569.39,93.06,8.80" target="#b7">(Benedek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,137.65,569.39,81.39,8.80" target="#b40">Kenett et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,223.37,569.39,58.88,8.80;9,40.25,581.40,47.63,8.80" target="#b42">Kenett, Beaty, et al., 2016)</ref>. The full network results, however, are mostly qualitative because they cannot be statistically tested directly. Our quantitative assessment involved a partial bootstrapped network approach . The partial bootstrapped networks revealed results that were in line with the full networks and consistent across the bootstrapped realizations. The partial networks of the high openness to experience group exhibited significantly smaller ASPL and Q and a larger CC than the partial networks of the low openness to experience group, supporting the findings for the full networks. In addition, the effect sizes ranged from moderate to very large, suggesting these differences are substantial. Notably, the more nodes that were retained, the larger the effect sizes were. This seems to suggest that, at the full network level, the network structures are very different.</p><p>Overall, these findings suggest that the high openness to experience group had a more flexible semantic organization-that is, a less rigid network structure (smaller Q). A growing body of research is demonstrating Q's role in flexibility of thought, by constraining the spread of activation over semantic and phonological networks <ref type="bibr" coords="9,365.10,137.39,109.56,8.80" target="#b43">Kenett, Gold, et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,478.83,137.39,47.85,8.80" target="#b73">Siew, 2013)</ref>. On the one hand, these studies implicate higher modularity in more structured networks, related to intelligence and language development <ref type="bibr" coords="9,406.83,173.39,104.34,8.80" target="#b10">(Borodkin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,518.41,173.39,28.82,8.80;9,305.29,185.41,80.79,8.80" target="#b42">Kenett, Beaty, et al., 2016)</ref>, until an extreme state of rigidity as seen in the semantic network of people with high functioning autism <ref type="bibr" coords="9,351.78,209.39,109.88,8.80" target="#b43">(Kenett, Gold, et al., 2016)</ref>. On the other hand, other studies reveal that lower modularity is related to higher creative ability . Thus, our results extend and further support the negative relation between modularity and flexibility in cognition.</p><p>The high openness to experience group also had greater interconnectivity (smaller ASPL) between nodes in the semantic network, suggesting they could more easily reach more remote associations. This result also suggests that people high in openness to experience might be less likely to perceive disparate concepts as unrelated <ref type="bibr" coords="9,494.43,329.41,52.83,8.80;9,305.29,341.37,40.62,8.80" target="#b69">(Rossman &amp; Fink, 2010</ref>). This quality could facilitate an enhanced ability to combine remote associations, which is thought to be a fundamental cognitive component of creative thinking <ref type="bibr" coords="9,305.29,377.37,117.02,8.80" target="#b26">(Finke, Ward, &amp; Smith, 1992)</ref>. In addition, the high openness to experience group had a larger CC, which suggests greater local organization. These two characteristics-small ASPL and large CC-are related to the structure of a small world network, which might support a more efficient search through semantic space <ref type="bibr" coords="9,402.52,437.40,107.89,8.80" target="#b51">(Marupaka &amp; Minai, 2011)</ref>. Indeed, <ref type="bibr" coords="9,305.29,449.36,75.99,8.80" target="#b3">Anderson's (1983)</ref> ACT model suggests that this interconnected, flexible structure facilitates the search and retrieval of associations in memory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Total and unique number of responses</head><p>Our behavioural findings support this notion: the high openness to experience group reported more response on average and more unique responses in general than the low openness to experience group. This was demonstrated by a small correlation between openness to experience and number of responses and corroborated by the t-test performed between the two groups. Moreover, this result is consistent with previous work that suggests that people higher in openness to experience have greater general knowledge than people with lower openness to experience <ref type="bibr" coords="9,445.44,640.36,101.77,8.80;9,305.29,652.38,21.43,8.80" target="#b1">(Ackerman &amp; Heggestad, 1997)</ref>. Similarly, the high openness to experience group generated more unique responses than the low openness to experience group, which is likely because they have a flexible, interconnected semantic network structure that may have allowed better access to less common responses . This finding is consistent with previous research, which demonstrated that people higher in openness to experience tend to provide more remote semantic responses <ref type="bibr" coords="9,358.07,748.36,100.07,8.80" target="#b66">(Prabhakaran et al., 2014)</ref>. Overall, these results complement the network structure of the high openness to experience group, which had shorter paths and increased flexibility of relations between concepts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>A few limitations exist in our study. Most prominently, although we removed items from the NEO-FFI-3 and BFAS that were related to intelligence and cognitive outcomes, these variables are only self-report and do not directly assess explicit cognitive ability. Therefore, future research should parse out the extent to which the relationship of openness to experience and semantic memory structure exists beyond cognitive abilities. A second limitation was that we examined how openness to experience is related to semantic memory structure at the aggregated, group level. Openness to experience varies across people <ref type="bibr" coords="10,155.11,251.39,91.11,8.80" target="#b64">(Oleynick et al., 2017)</ref>; thus, our aggregated group-based semantic networks might minimize such important relations between openness to experience and semantic memory structure at the individual level. Approaches to represent individual semantic networks are currently being developed <ref type="bibr" coords="10,144.57,311.37,90.45,8.80" target="#b7">(Benedek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,238.57,311.37,51.42,8.80;10,48.02,323.39,22.70,8.80" target="#b83">Zemla et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,73.42,323.39,108.40,8.80" target="#b82">Zemla &amp; Austerweil, 2018)</ref>. Thus, future work should use more sophisticated designs that are needed to examine the relation between openness to experience and semantic memory structure at the individual level. Finally, we applied bootstrapping methods as a way to statistically examine our network results, which is a common approach in cognitive and psychometric network analysis <ref type="bibr" coords="10,195.99,395.39,93.96,8.80" target="#b21">(Epskamp et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,48.02,407.41,105.79,8.80" target="#b43">Kenett, Gold, et al., 2016)</ref>. In our approach, we removed a percentage of nodes from the full networks and compute partial networks. In psychometric networks, however, it is more common to remove participants <ref type="bibr" coords="10,178.42,443.36,89.98,8.80" target="#b21">(Epskamp et al., 2018)</ref>. Removal of participants in semantic networks poses considerable difficulties, potentially leading to biasing the network measures and an over-representation of infrequent responses in the group's semantic network, which would also lead to biased results. Further statistical methodological development is needed to develop statistical tools that are better able to statistically examine the validity of the results of such empirical networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>The present study applied network science methodology to examine the relation between the structure of semantic concepts and high and low openness to experience groups. We found that the high group of openness to experience was related to a semantic network structure that was more interconnected, flexible, and had better local organization of associations. Behavioural analyses complemented these network findings by revealing that the high openness to experience group generated a greater number of unique responses and more responses on average in a semantic verbal fluency task. These findings provide support for the relationship between the structure of semantic memory and openness to experience. This study also provides evidence that differences in personality may be directly related to the structure, recall, and application of semantic information <ref type="bibr" coords="10,487.45,65.38,67.52,8.80;10,313.00,77.40,21.43,8.80" target="#b48">(Kwantes et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
