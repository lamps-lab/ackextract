<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Event timing engages a distributed neural network including cortical and subcortical structures. However, it remains unclear whether the early visual cortex contributes to event timing. Here we showed that the processes of nontemporal visual features such as orientation and spatial location, which are coded by the early visual cortex, contribute to the temporal representation of a visual stimulus. Participants were presented with 2 successive Gabor patches (a prime and a target) with different orientations or spatial locations. The subjective duration of the target was significantly reduced when it was preceded by the prime compared with when presented alone. More important, this duration-compression effect varied systematically as a function of orientation similarity or spatial proximity between the prime and the target and was influenced by how the prime and the target were perceptually grouped. Our results suggest that repetition suppression of neural activity in response to orientation may contribute to the observed duration distortion and that neurons in the early visual cortex with small receptive fields and orientation selectivity may be involved in visual temporal perception. Our findings help to understand the functional role of early visual cortex in event timing in humans.</p></div>

This finding indicates the contribution of orientation processing to duration perception but cannot rule out effects of cognitively engaging processes, such as prediction-error monitoring.

The prediction process may also modulate neural responses elicited by the oddball <ref type="bibr" coords="2,195.73,222.37,92.31,8.10;2,48.00,233.56,16.20,8.10" target="#b45">(Pariyadath &amp; Eagleman, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,64.20,233.56,24.43,8.10" target="#b36">, 2012</ref>. Thus it remains unclear where such modulation occurs in the visual processing pathway and how it interacts with duration computation. To examine the contributions of the early visual cortex to time perception, a task design should be largely independent of cognitively engaging processes and measure the effect of visual features specifically encoded by neurons in the early visual cortex. Because neurons in the early visual cortex code specific orientations of stimuli presented at specific locations, it may be inferred that these neurons contribute to temporal perception if the subjective duration of a stimulus in a sequence of repeated stimuli is affected by the orientation and spatial position of preceding stimuli.</p><p>In this regard, we used a paradigm that presented a pair of stimuli and measured the subjective duration of the second stimulus as a function of the difference in orientation and spatial distance between the two stimuli.

All participants were paid volunteers and had normal or correctedto-normal vision. They were naive about the purpose of the study and gave written informed consent prior to their participation.</p><p>Stimuli and procedure. Stimulus presentation and data collection were controlled by a PC running Matlab 7.1 and Psychophysics Toolbox extensions <ref type="bibr" coords="3,154.67,505.85,59.83,8.10" target="#b4">(Brainard, 1997)</ref>. Stimuli were presented on a CRT monitor (ViewSonic Professional Series P97fϩ) with a refresh rate of 75 Hz and a gray background (7.7 cd/m 2 ). Each trial began with the presentation of a fixation cross (0.3°ϫ 0.3°, 44.6 cd/m 2 ), which stayed on the screen throughout the trial. After a variable interval of between 800 and 1,000 ms, two randomly ordered stimulus periods separated by an interval of 1,200 -1,600 ms were presented. In each period, a prime-target pair or a comparison stimulus was shown on the screen. The prime, the target, and the comparison were all Gabor patches with a fixed size (1.6°ϫ 1.6°in Experiment 1A and 2.0°ϫ 2.0°in Experiment 1B), spatial frequency (2.5 c/deg in Experiment 1A and 2.0 c/deg in Experiment 1B), standard deviation of the spatial Gaussian window (0.27°in Experiment 1A and 0.33°in Experiment 1B), and contrast (100% with a mean luminance of 7.7 cd/m 2 ). Being presented randomly to the left or right of the fixation at the eccentricity of 5°, the prime and the target were displayed at the same position, while the comparison appeared at the mirror position in the opposite hemifield (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,172.49,703.85,33.79,8.10" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). The prime (107 ms) always preceded the target (307 ms) with an ISI of 187 ms. The duration of the comparison varied among 120, 200, 267, 307, 347, 400, or 480 ms in Experiment 1A. In Experiment 1B, a modified QUEST adaptive procedure <ref type="bibr" coords="3,407.41,98.85,83.18,8.10" target="#b56">(Watson &amp; Pelli, 1983)</ref> determined the duration of the comparison in each trial using information accumulated from preceding trials. At the end of each trial, participants were required to make a two-alternative forced-choice response to judge which, the target or the comparison, appeared longer by pressing the left or right button to indicate its position.</p><p>In Experiment 1A, the orientation of the prime differed from that of the target by 45°in half of the trials and by 90°in the other half. The direction of orientation difference was either clockwise or counterclockwise. The comparison was identical to the target, and its orientation was either horizontal or vertical. In Experiment 1B, a parametric assessment of the duration effect was designed in which the prime was tilted relative to the target by 22.5°, 45°, 67.5°, or 90°. Orientations of the target and the comparison were vertical.</p><p>Trials with different combinations of the prime, the target, and the comparison were randomly interspersed in one block.

Behavioral data were initially analyzed in each condition to estimate the point of subjective equality (PSE) at which the observer perceives equal durations of the comparison and the target. In Experiment 1A, the percentages of judging the comparison to be of longer duration than the target were fitted with a Weibull function <ref type="bibr" coords="3,376.75,395.85,66.62,8.10" target="#b59">(Zhou et al., 2010)</ref>. PSEs were then calculated from the sigmoid function at the point of 50% performance. In Experiment 1B, the PSE of each condition was estimated with a modified QUEST adaptive procedure with a 50% performance criterion for a 40-trial run <ref type="bibr" coords="3,404.06,439.85,84.37,8.10" target="#b56">(Watson &amp; Pelli, 1983)</ref>. The results of multiple QUEST runs were averaged to get a final estimate of the PSE in each condition for each participant. Statistical analysis was focused on estimated PSEs using repeated-measures ANOVAs and t tests. The Greenhouse-Geisser procedure was used to correct the degree of freedom whenever the sphericity assumption was violated for within-subject comparisons. The calculated probability p value was adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Experiment 1A demonstrated that the percentage of the comparison stimulus (vs. the target stimulus) being of a longer subjective duration increased with the comparison duration, showing a monotonous trend that can be fitted by a Weibull function (see <ref type="figure" coords="3,306.00,615.85,36.89,8.10" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref> for an example). It is interesting that the psychometric curve for a 45°orientation difference between the prime and the target shifted to the left of the curve for a 90°difference, suggesting that the duration of the target tended to be judged shorter in the 45°relative to 90°conditions. To statistically confirm these effects, we entered the estimated PSEs of targets in a series of t tests.

It is possible that the stronger duration compression in the 45°(oblique) condition than in the 90°(vertical and horizontal) condition was a consequence of different sensitivities between orientations rather than different orientation similarities between the prime and the target. In Experiment 1B, we varied the orientation of the prime systematically to investigate whether an obliquely oriented prime could modulate the apparent duration of the target on the basis of the orientation similarity between stimuli. As shown in <ref type="figure" coords="4,353.51,604.85,34.67,8.10" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>, there was an inverted Mexican-hat profile of PSEs. The subjective duration of the target decreased, whereas the compression effect increased as a function of the orientation similarity between the prime and the target. Before applying the significance test of this trend, we first checked whether the compression effect depended on the direction of orientation difference using an ANOVA with direction (clockwise and counterclockwise) and orientation difference (22.5°, 45°, and 67.5°; data from the 90°condition were not included because the 90°condition did not distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise directions) as within-subject variables.

Thus, the orientation-based duration effect also occurs in oblique orientations, and the primary factor determining the size of compression is the orientation difference between stimuli. Taken together, the results of Experiment 1 indicate that participants tended to underestimate the duration of a visual stimulus when it was preceded by another stimulus with a similar orientation.

It is important to note that the sizes of receptive fields are not homogenous along the visual pathway. For neurons responding to stimuli at the eccentricity of ϳ5°, the sizes of the receptive fields have been estimated to be less than 2°in the primary visual cortex V1, between 2°and 4°in the extrastriate cortex V2, and larger than 4°in the area V4 <ref type="bibr" coords="5,211.27,505.85,76.77,8.10" target="#b35">(Kastner et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,48.00,516.85,65.08,8.10" target="#b51">Smith et al., 2001)</ref>.

Because primes were presented in upper and lower quadrants in different trials, we checked whether the stimulus quadrant affected the perceived duration using an ANOVA with factors of quadrant (upper and lower), orientation difference (22.5°a nd 67.5°), and spatial distance (1°, 2°, and 4°; 0°was not included because it did not index the quadrant).

The orientationbased effect, however, failed to reach significance in Experiment 2. Unlike those in Experiment 1B, the prime and the target in Experiment 2 were different in both orientation and spatial location, which might attenuate the orientation-based effect. However, different participants took part in Experiments 1B and 2. Therefore, the absence of an orientation effect in Experiment 2 might also result from the sampling difference.

However, we found a significant contextual effect in 67.5°trials, t(15) ϭ 2.62, p ϭ .038, Cohen's d ϭ 0.66, but not in 22.5°trials, t(15) ϭ 0.27, p Ͼ .99, Cohen's d ϭ 0.07 (cf. the Spat0 conditions in <ref type="figure" coords="7,246.51,538.85,33.63,8.10">Figure 3B</ref>). This indicates that the spatial attention did not play a key role in determining the duration pattern. The duration compression was probably dominated by spatial proximity, and the orientation effect was weakened when both the orientation and the spatial location differed between the prime and the target.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>In the current study, we investigated whether the processes of a nontemporal visual feature mediated by the early visual cortex contribute to the temporal representation of a visual stimulus. We found evidence that orientation similarity (Experiment 1) and spatial proximity (Experiment 2) between the prime and the target significantly influenced the perceived duration of the target. Specifically, increasing the orientation similarity or decreasing the spatial distance significantly reduced the perceived duration of the target. We also found that the compression effect depended on task contexts because the orientation-based duration compression was significantly attenuated when spatial proximity dominated orientation similarity in grouping the prime and the target (Experiment 3). This contextual effect, independent of the physical properties of the stimulus and retinal processes, cannot be fully explained by a spatial attention shift and highlights the effect of perceptual organization on the subjective perception of time.</p><p>Our findings provide new evidence for the involvement of the early cortical areas in the computation of apparent duration of a visual stimulus. The duration compression was not only attuned to orientation differences between the prime and the target but also sensitive to the spatial distance between them. In some cases, a spatial separation as small as 1°dramatically changed the perceived duration of the target (Experiment 2). This finding suggests that area V1, in which neurons are orientation selective in receptive fields smaller than 1° <ref type="bibr" coords="7,405.79,252.85,84.17,8.10" target="#b35">(Kastner et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,493.88,252.85,52.17,8.10" target="#b42">Nelson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,306.00,263.85,69.27,8.10" target="#b51">Smith et al., 2001)</ref>, may play a role in time perception. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that timing processes engage neurons that code nontemporal features that characterize the receptive field property of cells in the early visual cortex.

By limiting the stimulus sequence to a prime-target pair, we were able to control the prediction effect caused by sequence regularities to a certain degree in the current study. It is worthy to note that targets were still predictable when the task used only pairs of primes and targets. However, targets occurred with equal probability following the presentation of different primes and there seemed to be no a priori reason for an observer to favor one condition over the others. Thus the prediction based on task contexts would have similar effects in different conditions and was unlikely to explain the results in the current study. We also used Gabor patches, which optimally activate orientation-selective neurons with small receptive fields to explore the contribution of the early visual cortex to subjective time, which is difficult to examine in studies using complex natural images and geometric figures <ref type="bibr" coords="7,375.51,626.84,65.50,8.10" target="#b38">(Matthews, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,445.27,626.84,96.90,8.10" target="#b43">Noguchi &amp; Kakigi, 2006)</ref>.

Therefore, our findings indicate that neurons in V1 that are thought to encode nontemporal features of stimuli may, nevertheless, contribute to subjective timing.

As a result, a prime that is similar to a target in orientation and spatial position causes strong adaptation in the neural responses to the target, and the decreased neural responses to the target may lead to reduced subjective duration of the target. Thus, it is likely that the response magnitude of visual neurons provides a signal of the duration of a stimulus. This hypothesis is further supported by a contextual modulation of subjective duration in which the perceptual organization plays a crucial role.

Correspondingly, the orientation-based duration compression was attenuated (Experiment 3), suggesting that the subjective time is contingent on the perceptual organization of a prime and a target and is associated with neural responses that are modulated by grouping processes.</p><p>The behavioral results reported in our study do not indicate where the final registration of temporal information is accomplished <ref type="bibr" coords="8,76.65,494.85,86.68,8.10" target="#b7">(Buhusi &amp; Meck, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,165.97,494.85,77.54,8.10" target="#b29">Ivry &amp; Schlerf, 2008)</ref>. Responses in the early visual cortex may directly compute subjective time, and the perceived duration depends on the quality (e.g., signal-tonoise ratio) of local signals. It is scarcely less likely that clock ticks occur in specified neural structures, such as basal ganglia and supplementary motor areas, which receive inputs from the early visual cortex, and the subjective time is determined by the number of signals communicated between cortical regions. These can be tested in future research.</p><p>Recent findings propose a Bayesian explanation of time perception <ref type="bibr" coords="8,64.35,604.84,97.13,8.10" target="#b32">(Jazayeri &amp; Shadlen, 2010)</ref>, stating that the perceived interval is biased toward the mean of sample intervals in a given context. However, Bayesian mechanisms seem to play a minor, if any, role in shaping the contextual effect in the current study. In Experiment 3, adding spatially dissociated primes led to a higher proportion of long-perceived durations in the SPACE session compared with the ORIEN session. In the context of a Bayesian process <ref type="bibr" coords="8,245.73,670.84,42.31,8.10;8,48.00,681.84,55.20,8.10" target="#b32">(Jazayeri &amp; Shadlen, 2010)</ref>, this change in subjective duration distribution would shift the PSEs of the Spat0 conditions in the SPACE session toward longer values (vs. those in the ORIEN session). However, the PSEs did not vary with session for the 22.5°condition and actually decreased from the ORIEN session to the SPACE session for the 67.5°condition (see <ref type="figure" coords="8,409.56,87.84,34.22,8.10">Figure 3B</ref>). This is apparently inconsistent with the prediction of the Bayesian mechanisms. Thus, our results are better explained by a change in dominant grouping mechanisms in which the grouping process based on orientation similarity is attenuated and thus leads to a reduced compression effect associated with orientation difference. Nevertheless, the Bayesian mechanisms may interact with the perceptual grouping processes at certain levels. Such interaction, however, is probably a consequence rather than a cause of the subjective time contingent on perceptual organization.</p><p>Our findings have several important implications to studies of multiple level neural and cognitive processes. First, the paradigm developed in our work provides a simple and efficient way to examine the neural properties of the early visual areas, including V1 and V2. This method does not require complex neurophysiological recordings and traditional adaptation procedures. The tuning profiles of neurons estimated by this subjective-time method are comparable to those in previous studies <ref type="bibr" coords="8,477.80,274.84,68.26,8.10;8,306.00,285.84,19.37,8.10" target="#b16">(Ferster &amp; Miller, 2000)</ref>, indicating that it can be used as a tool to examine the neural responses related to perception and cognition. Second, temporal information is critical for high-level cognitive processes involved in decision making, prediction, and motor control <ref type="bibr" coords="8,505.59,318.84,40.44,8.10;8,306.00,329.84,46.73,8.10" target="#b7">(Buhusi &amp; Meck, 2005)</ref>. Our findings of the engagement of early visual processing in event timing raise an interesting issue, that is, whether and how early perceptual processes in the visual cortex produce effects on high-level cognitive process involved in decision making and prediction. Thus our study calls attention to the contribution of sensory and perceptual processing to high-level cognitive processes. Finally, event timing and orientation similarity seem to be very different domains in terms of processes and functional significance for daily life and previous research usually investigated them separately. Our findings provide an example of the interaction between two apparently different domains in human mental processes, which may be taken into consideration in future research on mechanisms involved in different task domains.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,117.00,455.84,360.01,7.20;4,117.00,465.84,360.05,7.20;4,117.00,475.84,360.03,7.20;4,117.00,485.84,360.01,7.20;4,117.00,495.84,360.02,7.20;4,117.00,505.84,360.03,7.20;4,117.00,515.84,360.04,7.20;4,117.00,525.31,302.41,8.00"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>A.
