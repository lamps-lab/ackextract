<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Although it is clear that coworker absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover can influence an employee's actions, scholars have yet to consider the impact of relational demography on the adoption of these behavioral norms. Inspired by social identity, situational strength, and attraction-selection-attrition theories, we proposed that individuals who differ from their coworkers in age, sex, or racioethnicity would feel threatened by their outnumbered status and subsequently motivated to be absent, tardy, or more likely to turnover. However, we expected coworker withdrawal behavior to moderate whether or not dissimilar personnel act on these desires. Results from hierarchical multilevel modeling analyses of data from 470 U.S. call center workers nested in 51 work groups revealed that racioethnic dissimilarity was positively related to time-lagged changes in absenteeism and tardiness as well as heightened turnover likelihood. These effects emerged only among employees whose coworkers engaged in greater withdrawal behavior. Importantly, racioethnically dissimilar employees working in more permissive climates (i.e., those with high levels of coworker absenteeism, tardiness, or turnover) exhibited the greatest increases in absenteeism and tardiness over three months and had the highest supervisor-rated turnover likelihood. Implications for diversity management are discussed. Copyright</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Impact of Demographic Dissimilarity on Employee Withdrawal</head><p>Employee withdrawal refers to a family of behaviors in which an employee is psychologically and/or physically away from the workplace in some capacity. These behaviors vary in severity and range from working slowly, surfing the Internet, and taking unnecessary breaks to arriving to work late, being absent, or quitting altogether <ref type="bibr" coords="3,454.35,318.85,50.56,8.80;3,44.96,330.87,18.00,8.80" target="#b112">(Koslowsky, 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,70.13,330.87,17.15,8.80" target="#b113">(Koslowsky, , 2009</ref>. Some researchers have proposed that all withdrawal behaviors are indicators of a common underlying construct reflecting the desire to disengage from the workplace due to unfavorable job attitudes <ref type="bibr" coords="3,430.53,342.89,74.35,8.80;3,44.96,354.86,22.70,8.80" target="#b80">(Hanisch &amp; Hulin, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,71.09,354.86,49.95,8.80" target="#b93">Hulin, 1991)</ref>. Empirical studies, however, have shown that absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover likelihood have different antecedents (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,177.39,366.87,95.70,8.80" target="#b95">Iverson &amp; Deery, 2001)</ref>, and that meta-analytic correlations between the various withdrawal behaviors are small to modest at best <ref type="bibr" coords="3,240.04,378.89,131.59,8.80" target="#b15">(Berry, Lelchook, &amp; Clark, 2012)</ref>. More importantly, different theoretical frameworks exist for each of the behaviors. For example, Johns (2001) described a number of reasons why employees are absent ranging from illness to attending a family event. Many of these motives are unrelated to dissatisfaction with one's job, the organization, or its members (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,315.33,414.89,173.71,8.80" target="#b78">Halbesleben, Whitman, &amp; Crawford, 2014)</ref>. In contrast, turnover has been well documented to occur through an unfolding process whereby employees follow one of several psychological paths when leaving their jobs <ref type="bibr" coords="3,276.84,438.87,91.02,8.80" target="#b118">(Lee &amp; Mitchell, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,370.10,438.87,134.84,8.80;3,44.96,450.89,51.88,8.80" target="#b119">Lee, Mitchell, Holtom, McDaneil, &amp; Hill, 1999)</ref>. Notably, no such detailed map of decision points exists for tardiness or absenteeism. Overall, the empirical and theoretical evidence suggest that the aggregated withdrawal model is less viable than treating tardiness, absenteeism, and turnover likelihood as related, yet qualitatively unique, behaviors <ref type="bibr" coords="3,379.28,474.88,76.05,8.80" target="#b15">(Berry et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,458.14,474.88,46.81,8.80" target="#b20">Blau, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,44.96,486.89,49.67,8.80" target="#b103">Johns, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>We use the term, "withdrawal," as a way to group these behaviors together (i.e., absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover likelihood all indicate that an employee is either physically away from the workplace or is considering exiting the organization) rather than to suggest a unified underlying construct. Accordingly, we examine these behaviors separately in order to better understand the nature of each. In later sections, we discuss the theory underlying why demographically dissimilar others are motivated to remove themselves from the workplace.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic dissimilarity</head><p>The organizational diversity literature is composed of myriad studies that examine the effects of people working together who differ from one another in terms of specific attributes such as demographics, personality, or functional background <ref type="bibr" coords="3,95.19,629.36,233.92,8.80" target="#b76">(Guillaume, Dawson, Woods, Sacramento, &amp; West, 2013)</ref>.

According to this theory, individuals who are similar in terms of attitudes, personality, and demographic characteristics are more attracted to one another than individuals who are dissimilar. Because people like to view themselves positively, heightened similarity with one's coworkers or supervisor often results in perceptions of a supportive working environment and, correspondingly, less discrimination <ref type="bibr" coords="4,62.02,365.40,94.00,8.80" target="#b179">(Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986)</ref>.

Will the penchant to protect one's self from identity threat trump the tendency to conform to behavioral norms or vice versa?</p><p>In its simplest form, an interaction can be represented by four quadrants combining the high and low conditions of the two independent variables. 1 Applied here, the two quadrants involving employees who are demographically similar to their coworkers have straightforward conclusions.

Proportional rarity heightens visibility for those in the numerical minority, which can call attention to one's distinctiveness and promote boundary heightening (i.e., the exaggeration of perceived differences between majority and minority group members; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,351.67,545.40,55.09,8.80" target="#b108">Kanter, 2006)</ref> and stigmatization <ref type="bibr" coords="6,484.45,545.40,37.52,8.80;6,62.02,557.36,59.13,8.80" target="#b123">(Major &amp; O'Brien, 2005)</ref>.

In contrast, employees exhibited lower absenteeism, irrespective of their motivation to do so, when coworker absenteeism was uniformly low. Although coworker withdrawal behavior does not enhance or diminish the psychological experience of being different, we propose that it might encourage or discourage an individual's outward behavior. Therefore, we posit that demographically dissimilar individuals will conform to the behavior of others in strong situations (i.e., low coworker absenteeism, tardiness, or turnover) to avoid potentially exacerbating identity threat. In weak situations (i.e., high coworker absenteeism, tardiness, or turnover), they will have the highest increases in these behaviors.

Upon witnessing these behaviors, employees frequently conclude that they, too, deserve better and should consider looking for greener pastures elsewhere <ref type="bibr" coords="9,345.61,113.40,74.33,8.80" target="#b59">(Felps et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Consequently, we suggest that the turnover of one's coworkers will play a significant role in whether or not one formulates their own plans to leave the organization. Specifically, in groups where coworkers are frequently leaving for other opportunities, morale and support among the remaining members are likely to be very low, thereby further alienating the dissimilar member. In groups where few coworkers are turning over, however, incentives that stave off leaving may also help to mitigate the identity threat associated with being different. These factors increase the likelihood that dissimilar members will stay in the organization as well.</p><p>Two previous studies have examined contextual moderators of the relationship between demographic dissimilarity and the related constructs of intent to quit and turnover. In the first, <ref type="bibr" coords="9,334.72,209.38,104.57,8.80" target="#b160">Sacco and Schmitt (2005)</ref> found that, as a function of time, individuals who were demographically dissimilar from their cohort were more likely to turnover earlier in their tenure rather than later. In the second investigation, <ref type="bibr" coords="9,323.49,233.36,117.60,8.80" target="#b70">Gonzalez and DeNisi (2009)</ref> found a strong positive relationship between racioethnic dissimilarity and intentions to quit among Hispanic employees working in an adverse diversity climate (i.e., a work environment unsupportive of diversity); this relationship did not hold when diversity climates were perceived as supportive or among non-Hispanic employees. The results of these studies suggest that environmental and temporal factors can influence when and how relational demography impacts employee withdrawal.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: Coworker turnover moderates the positive demographic dissimilarity-turnover likelihood relationship, such that it is stronger among workers whose coworkers have high versus low average turnover rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research context</head><p>Participants were employees working in the in-bound call center of a private sector organization located in the United States. They performed customer service tasks (e.g., relaying information and explaining policies) and were not involved in selling. They worked in cubicles in close proximity to their coworkers who reported to the same supervisor. Whereas they used telephony technology to initiate calls and customer relationship software to access account and product information, they often relied on each other for information and advice on handling customer problems. In addition, employees were called upon to complete the work tasks of coworkers who were absent or tardy. Finally, periodic team meetings and training sessions provided formal opportunities for interacting with coworkers face-to-face. The three levels of management above the first-line supervisor did not change during the study period. Occasionally, workers were monitored by a quality control manager, who also was in place during the entire data-collection period. Furthermore, there were no major structural or technological changes. Hence, the work environment was relatively stable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and procedure</head><p>The data were collected from the human resource records of 470 of 703 (66.9 percent) employees (age M = 30 years; tenure M = 3 years). Although this particular organization is somewhat female dominated (72 percent), there is considerable racioethnic diversity (29 percent Black, 25 percent Hispanic, and 46 percent White). Workers were nested within 51 work groups, defined as a team of employees working together under a single supervisor. These groups ranged considerably in sex (0-100 percent female), racioethnic (0-86 percent Black; 0-100 percent Hispanic; 0-100 percent White), and age diversity (age SD range = 0.12-24.22). All of the variables (with the exception of turnover likelihood) were assessed at two time points: once at the close of the third month of the year (first quarter) and once again three months later at the close of the sixth month (second quarter). Supervisors rated the turnover likelihood of employees only at the second time point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Absence and tardiness. All absence and tardiness values (coworker and employee) were acquired from the organization's human resource information system. Employee arrival times were automatically entered into the call center's shift management software database when employees logged into the computer system. An indicator of tardiness was automatically entered into the human resource information system (i.e., data sent from the shift management software) when an employee logged in more than five minutes later than the start of the shift. Absences from work were recorded by the shift management software and sent to the human resource information system when employees did not log onto the computer system on assigned work days. Time 1 values were for the first quarter of the year, and Time 2 values were for the second quarter. Absences ranged from zero to eight at Time 1 (M = 0.53; SD = 1.32) and from zero to 17 at Time 2 (M = 0.86; SD = 1.94); tardiness values ranged from zero to seven at both time points (Time 1 M = 0.56; SD = 1.40; Time 2 M = 0.68; SD = 1.54). As is commonplace in withdrawal studies, absence and tardiness values were skewed and truncated at zero. Consequently, we transformed these variables using natural log transformations to reduce the skew and kurtosis values to acceptable levels. Some researchers have opted to use generalized linear models, such as Poisson regression, to deal with the typical distribution of withdrawal behavior; however, such analyses assume that individual instances of withdrawal are independent from one another, which is often not the case (e.g., faulty transportation could lead to consecutive instances of tardiness).</p><p>To compute coworker values, we followed the convention of other researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="10,414.26,375.38,107.74,8.80" target="#b53">Eder &amp; Eisenberger, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,62.02,387.40,93.96,8.80" target="#b64">Gellatly &amp; Allen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,158.40,387.40,85.97,8.80" target="#b66">Glomb &amp; Liao, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,246.78,387.40,135.90,8.80" target="#b158">Robinson &amp; O'Leary-Kelly, 1998)</ref>, and summed the group members' Time 1 values, subtracted the value of the focal employee, and divided by the number of group members minus one. This produced the average absenteeism by all members of the group except the focal employee (i.e., coworker absenteeism). To compute employee values, we subtracted the transformed Time 1 value from the transformed Time 2 value. This produced the change in the focal employee's absence or tardiness from Time 1 to Time 2.</p><p>Average coworker turnover and turnover likelihood. To examine coworker turnover and individual turnover likelihood, we relied on multisource data. For coworker turnover, we computed the turnover rate for the group between Time 1 and Time 2 from the organization's human resources records (M = 0.26, SD = 0.31). For employees, supervisors of each work group completed a measure indicating how long they anticipated each of their employees to stay with the organization. Responses, which were collected at Time 2, were coded on a 6-point scale where 1 = more than one year, 2 = 10-12 months, 3 = six to nine months, 4 = three to five months, 5 = one to two months, and 6 = less than one month. Because supervisors did not complete this item for all employees, however, the working sample size for this variable was 268.</p><p>Demographic dissimilarity. Consistent with prior research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="10,317.31,569.38,73.31,8.80" target="#b16">Bhave et al., 2010)</ref>, we computed demographic dissimilarity using Euclidean distance, which captures the collective extent to which an individual is dissimilar to his or her coworkers. Separate values were calculated for sex, racioethnicity, and age with higher values indicating greater dissimilarity. For continuous variables such as age, the formula is the square root of the summed squared differences between an individual's age and the age for every other group member, divided by the total number of employees in the work group <ref type="bibr" coords="10,127.27,629.37,130.13,8.80">(Tonidandel et al., 2008, p. 621)</ref>. For racioethnicity and sex, the formula is the square root of the proportion of coworkers who do not belong to the focal employee's demographic group <ref type="bibr" coords="10,419.58,641.39,98.08,8.80" target="#b182">(Tonidandel et al., 2008)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>It was our aim to consider the prospective role of coworker absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover as contextual indicators of when it is acceptable or unacceptable to withdraw from an identity-threatening situation (i.e., when one is demographically dissimilar from coworkers). We expected low rates of coworker withdrawal behaviors to act as strong situations that constrain employee behavior to be concordant with their colleagues. Weak situations characterized by high withdrawal, irrespective of formal policies against it, introduce ambiguity concerning the  acceptability of such behavior. Under these conditions, we expected demographically dissimilar individuals to act in alignment with their motivations to withdraw and do so at the highest levels. Our results confirmed these hypotheses with respect to racioethnic dissimilarity, but not for sex or age dissimilarity. Racioethnically dissimilar employees, who ostensibly were motivated to withdraw as means to cope with potential stigmatization, only acted on this motivation and increased their frequency of absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover likelihood when such behavior was condoned socially (i.e., coworkers engaged in high levels of these behaviors). The marked increases in absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover likelihood among racioethnically similar employees in permissive climates are notable given the high logistical and financial costs associated with these behaviors <ref type="bibr" coords="15,44.96,353.38,51.16,8.80" target="#b19">(Blau, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,100.12,353.38,82.34,8.80" target="#b56">Elicker et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,186.52,353.38,82.72,8.80" target="#b178">Stewart et al., 2003)</ref>. Increases in absenteeism and tardiness could be particularly detrimental to organizations if employees use this time to act on their intentions to leave, and engage in job-seeking behaviors such as interviews and site visits <ref type="bibr" coords="15,278.37,377.36,51.10,8.80" target="#b79">(Hale, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,333.53,377.36,74.61,8.80" target="#b161">Sagie et al., 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Another important takeaway from these findings is the importance of considering the social and organizational context when studying the effects of relational demography and withdrawal. In the present study, racioethnic dissimilarity's relation to changes in absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover likelihood depended on coworker behavior. These results echo the findings of previous researchers suggesting that employees look to others' behavior when deciding whether or not to act on internal motivations to withdraw (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,353.94,437.40,112.23,8.80" target="#b9">Bamberger &amp; Biron, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,470.39,437.40,34.52,8.80;15,44.96,449.36,72.55,8.80" target="#b17">Biron &amp; Bamberger, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,120.81,449.36,79.85,8.80" target="#b49">Diestel et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,203.98,449.36,95.48,8.80" target="#b64">Gellatly &amp; Allen, 2012)</ref>. Accordingly, we suggest that researchers place a stronger emphasis on the context or else mixed findings will continue to abound (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="15,406.04,461.38,73.67,8.80" target="#b107">Joshi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,483.54,461.38,21.33,8.80;15,44.96,473.40,47.23,8.80" target="#b146">Perry et al., 1999)</ref>. Furthermore, we encourage future research to identify and measure the theoretical underpinnings of these relationships.</p><p>The results of our study potentially contribute to the relational demography and withdrawal literatures in at least three key ways. First, we answered calls for more investigations into complex predictors of withdrawal <ref type="bibr" coords="15,475.99,509.40,28.95,8.80;15,44.96,521.36,23.05,8.80" target="#b105">(Johns, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,73.70,521.36,77.46,8.80" target="#b112">Koslowsky, 2000)</ref> as well other contextual factors when studying demographically diverse groups <ref type="bibr" coords="15,44.96,533.38,68.42,8.80" target="#b32">(Chatman, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,116.40,533.38,112.94,8.80" target="#b36">Chattopadhyay et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,232.36,533.38,92.76,8.80" target="#b51">DiTomaso et al., 2007)</ref>. When examining the longitudinal changes in tardiness and absenteeism, we found that, contrary to previous research, there was no significant main effect of coworker behavior. When considering relational demography and the social context together, however, we were able to predict a sizeable proportion of variance in our outcomes. There was both similarity and uniqueness in the pattern of results across the different forms of withdrawal. They were similar in that the moderating effects of age and sex were not significant and the conditional effects of racioethnic dissimilarity were significantly positive when coworker withdrawal was high. The effects differed in that the high coworker withdrawal conditional effect was markedly higher than the low coworker withdrawal conditional effect (as would be expected) for absenteeism and turnover, but not tardiness. This further supports the notion that such behaviors should be examined individually. Second, we joined a growing number of researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,305.81,77.40,68.92,8.80" target="#b121">Liao et al., 2004)</ref> studying the impact of demographic dissimilarity on work outcomes in response to increasing workforce diversity. As noted earlier, previous studies have relied primarily on a variation of the similarity-attraction paradigm to explain how people will be generally attracted to those who are similar and wary of those who are different (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,378.83,113.40,97.65,8.80" target="#b64">Gellatly &amp; Allen, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,480.20,113.40,41.72,8.80;16,62.02,125.36,48.50,8.80" target="#b73">Guillaume et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,113.84,125.36,75.29,8.80" target="#b144">Pelled et al., 1999)</ref>. We contend that, although this may describe the psychological effects of demographic dissimilarity, the social context will determine whether individuals act on these motivations. Hence, the mixed effects of relational demography found in previous studies might follow from a failure to consider coworker behavior as a moderating factor. We surmise that demographically dissimilar individuals may self-regulate their behavior in the face of interpersonal cues <ref type="bibr" coords="16,239.70,173.38,202.68,8.80" target="#b77">(Guillaume, van Knippenerg, &amp; Brodbeck, 2014)</ref>. Specifically, only among those employees working in weak situations (i.e., situations where people were absent, tardy, and quitting more frequently) did dissimilarity exert its effects. One implication of our findings, then, is that we must consider the dominant behavioral norms of an organization when studying the effects of relational demography.</p><p>Third, we used longitudinal data to pinpoint how previous coworker behaviors impact changes in employee absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover likelihood over time. Following Dello <ref type="bibr" coords="16,354.79,233.36,74.19,8.80" target="#b48">Russo et al. (2013)</ref>, we went beyond simply assessing the effects of absenteeism norms or concurrent coworker behaviors on individual behavior. Instead, we present evidence that the withdrawal behaviors of one's coworkers can influence an employee's subsequent decisions to be absent or late more frequently, as well as to their perceived likelihood of leaving the organization. Importantly, the effects for absenteeism and tardiness held over and above the individual's rate of these behaviors at Time 1, enabling us to isolate the change in these behaviors resulting from observing coworker actions. Moreover, our measures were objective in nature and not as susceptible to perceptual biases that often plague self-report questionnaires (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,127.11,317.38,49.67,8.80" target="#b100">Johns, 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and opportunities for future research</head><p>We emphasize three limitations of the current study. First, contrary to expectations, dissimilarity in age and sex did not interact with coworker withdrawal to predict any of the individual-level employee withdrawal behaviors. In accordance with the ethnic prominence hypothesis <ref type="bibr" coords="16,287.79,402.36,181.33,8.80" target="#b120">(Levin, Sinclair, Veniegas, &amp; Taylor, 2002)</ref>, racioethnic dissimilarity may be more influential because this marker tends to be a more salient and powerful basis for categorization, segregation, and mistreatment than other demographic categories (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,434.74,426.40,87.25,8.80" target="#b94">Ito &amp; Urland, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,62.02,438.36,110.03,8.80" target="#b126">McCall &amp; Simmons, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,174.95,438.36,168.16,8.80" target="#b131">McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &amp; Cook, 2001)</ref>. Hence, the different types of demographic dissimilarity may engender disparities in stigma consciousness. Another potential explanation lies in research suggesting that some individuals are more conscious or aware of their stigmatized status <ref type="bibr" coords="16,450.60,462.40,71.45,8.80;16,62.02,474.36,23.07,8.80" target="#b24">(Brown &amp; Pinel, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,88.51,474.36,45.05,8.80" target="#b149">Pinel, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,141.54,474.36,17.51,8.80" target="#b150">Pinel, , 2002</ref>. Differing levels of stigma consciousness may have acted as an additional moderator, masking the results of our hypothesized relationships for sex and age dissimilarity. Finally, we note that our sample had a rather high percentage of women, 2 which meant that men were disproportionately more likely to find themselves in the minority when focusing on this demographic trait. Perhaps, asymmetric effects were operative wherein being the lone male in a group of women presented lower levels of identity threat than being the lone female in a group of men. Such effects have been demonstrated in previous research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,434.15,534.40,87.81,8.80;16,62.02,546.36,23.05,8.80" target="#b33">Chatman &amp; O'Reilly, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,87.76,546.36,81.54,8.80" target="#b96">Jackson et al., 1991)</ref>. Given the relatively young sample, a similar argument could be made for age dissimilarity. Namely, age-dissimilar individuals may have been overwhelmingly older rather than younger employees, and therefore equipped to utilize their expertise and tenure to buffer against identity threat. We invite future researchers to test these possibilities.</p><p>Second, we did not measure employees' actual feelings of identity threat, anxiety, or discomfort with being a demographic minority. Owing to the potential impact of stigma consciousness discussed previously, we may have found even stronger (or, with sex and age dissimilarity, significant) effects had we been able to identify the individuals who were most aware and negatively impacted by their outnumbered status. We encourage further investigation to explore how this additional construct potentially changes the nature of our hypothesized interactions.</p><p>Finally, we measured supervisors' assessments of employees' turnover likelihood. It is likely that many employees who are contemplating turnover may not share these sentiments explicitly with their boss or coworkers. Supervisors, therefore, are likely to be imperfect judges of who will turnover or remain with the organization. Consequently, we urge caution in generalizing our results given this limitation. We maintain that this measure is perhaps an underestimation of the true relationships between dissimilarity, coworker behavior, and turnover likelihood. Notwithstanding, replication using self-reported turnover intentions and actual turnover behavior is warranted.</p><p>In terms of future research, we call for more studies investigating whether or not the interaction between coworker behavior and demographic dissimilarity demonstrates a similar relationship when predicting other withdrawal behaviors such as production deviance and turnover. We are also intrigued by the implication this study may have for presenteeism, which refers to employees attending work even when suffering from a medical or mental illness that should keep them at home <ref type="bibr" coords="17,174.96,221.40,167.00,8.80" target="#b4">(Aronsson, Gustafsson, &amp; Dallner, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,345.44,221.40,145.76,8.80" target="#b71">Gosselin, Lemyre, &amp; Corneil, 2013)</ref>. It stands to reason that, in organizations with strong presenteeism norms, demographically dissimilar employees may feel compelled to come to work despite suffering from more mental and physical health hazards as a result of not fitting in. We encourage future researchers to explore this possibility, particularly given recent studies suggesting that presenteeism (a) may be even more costly to organizations than absenteeism <ref type="bibr" coords="17,426.00,269.36,78.90,8.80;17,44.96,281.38,122.59,8.80" target="#b67">(Goetzel, Hawkins, Ozminkowski, &amp; Wang, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,170.08,281.38,105.51,8.80" target="#b170">Schultz &amp; Edington, 2007)</ref>, and (b) is at least partially determined by the others' behavior in the workplace (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="17,167.76,293.40,99.33,8.80" target="#b78">Halbesleben et al., 2014)</ref>. Finally, we also urge impending work that explores how demographic dissimilarity impacts the unit-level relationships observed between satisfaction and commitment with group-level withdrawal (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="17,164.24,317.38,143.89,8.80" target="#b87">Hausknecht, Hiller, &amp; Vance, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>From a practical standpoint, we recommend that employers take several preemptive measures to reduce the amount of absenteeism, tardiness, and turnover likelihood in their organizations. Our findings add to a body of work that has demonstrated that withdrawal behaviors are heavily influenced by sociocultural characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="17,446.58,401.40,58.33,8.80;17,44.96,413.36,51.33,8.80" target="#b9">(Bamberger &amp; Biron, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,99.89,413.36,47.53,8.80" target="#b19">Blau, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,150.98,413.36,109.50,8.80" target="#b53">Eder &amp; Eisenberger, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,264.02,413.36,60.57,8.80" target="#b63">Gellatly, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,328.14,413.36,105.19,8.80" target="#b65">Gellatly &amp; Luchak, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,436.94,413.36,67.94,8.80" target="#b117">Lau et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,44.96,425.38,99.44,8.80" target="#b125">Mathieu &amp; Kohler, 1990)</ref>. Given this influence, organizations are advised to establish cultures that foster high levels of satisfaction and engagement in order to encourage all employees to be more mentally and physically present at work. By making an effort to communicate the importance of high-quality work and inclusion, as well as by providing support and challenging assignments, managers can ensure that behavioral norms of enthusiasm, embeddedness, and absorption emerge rather than widespread disinterest and withdrawal <ref type="bibr" coords="17,412.62,473.40,92.31,8.80;17,44.96,485.36,22.70,8.80" target="#b164">(Sarangi &amp; Srivastava, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,70.87,485.36,70.19,8.80" target="#b181">Tomlinson, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Aside from the general social context effects, our findings also imply that special attention should be paid to applying diversity management strategies to ensure that demographically dissimilar individuals are integrated into work teams as quickly and effectively as possible. As <ref type="bibr" coords="17,261.42,521.36,84.67,8.80">(Kulik, 2014, p. 131)</ref> noted, "workforce diversity can deliver organisational benefits but only if it is effectively managed." We propose that simply attracting and hiring people of different demographic backgrounds is insufficient. Additional steps must be taken to facilitate racioethnically dissimilar personnel's full integration into their work teams and the overall organizational culture. Taking such steps will reduce their motivations to skip work, arrive late, or voice desires to quit.</p><p>We encourage organizations to employ mentoring and team-building practices to help employees move past surface-level demographic observations and focus on deep-level similarity (i.e., values, work styles, and personality). Research has suggested that implementing fair human resources practices and instituting company-wide activities designed to increase awareness and promote social integration can enhance diversity climate perceptions <ref type="bibr" coords="17,484.11,617.40,20.80,8.80;17,44.96,629.36,72.83,8.80" target="#b110">(Kim &amp; Gelfand, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,121.78,629.36,147.20,8.80" target="#b115">Kossek, Markel, &amp; McHugh, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,272.98,629.36,135.46,8.80" target="#b129">McKay, Avery, &amp; Morris, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,412.45,629.36,92.46,8.80;17,44.96,641.38,62.72,8.80" target="#b139">Mor Barak, Cherin, &amp; Berkman, 1998)</ref>.

For obvious strategic, ethical, and legal reasons, selecting for demographic similarity is not a prudent option. A better way to effectively achieve increased fit is through the socialization processes of onboarding new employees <ref type="bibr" coords="18,244.24,137.38,67.04,8.80" target="#b31">(Chatman, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="18,314.03,137.38,99.96,8.80" target="#b134">Meglino &amp; Ravlin, 1998)</ref>.

(2002)</ref> outlined two major means of social integration in teams to overcome the negative effects of surface-level and deep-level diversity. These authors noted that paying attention to deep-level characteristics of employees may be particularly useful when making decisions about team composition. One strategy they recommend is to leverage "differences in knowledge, skills, and abilities, while minimizing differences in job-related beliefs, attitudes, and values" <ref type="bibr" coords="18,275.19,281.38,83.99,8.80" target="#b86">(Harrison et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="18,377.24,281.38,17.15,8.80">(Harrison et al., , p. 1042</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In summary, despite prior evidence documenting the independent effects of demographic dissimilarity and coworker withdrawal on individual employee withdrawal, this study demonstrated that these effects are intertwined, at least with respect to racioethnicity. Specifically, racioethnic dissimilarity only results in changes in absenteeism and tardiness, and heightened supervisor-rated turnover likelihood if coworker withdrawal is high. In other words, when social norms were permissive, racioethnic dissimilarity exhibited the greatest increases in absenteeism and tardiness over time, and the highest perceived likelihood of turnover.</p></div>
