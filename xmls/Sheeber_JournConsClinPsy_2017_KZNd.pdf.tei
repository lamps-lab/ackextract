Thus, it is of critical importance to develop nontraditional service delivery systems to overcome barriers to treatment utilization. One approach to overcome barriers has been to integrate CBT into inhome visitation programs for at-risk mothers <ref type="bibr" coords="2,217.93,242.04,70.13,7.91;2,48.00,253.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b1">(Ammerman et al., 2013)</ref>. Another approach has been through the use of Internetdelivered CBT. Because online interventions allow greater flexibility to access services at times and places convenient to the user, and reduce costs associated with travel and therapist time, there is potential for them to overcome many of the barriers facing underserved populations. Moreover, because this approach enables remote delivery, it has particular promise for addressing the challenge posed by the scarcity of providers in rural areas <ref type="bibr" coords="2,257.38,330.04,30.68,7.91;2,48.00,341.04,50.66,7.91" target="#b33">(Gale &amp; Deprez, 2003)</ref>.

To this end, the rationale for the intervention was expanded to cover the relations between depressive symptoms and parenting. Moreover, the teaching of each skill included a discussion of its relevance for improving both mood and parenting behavior. These adaptations were informed by the work of <ref type="bibr" coords="2,315.82,187.04,124.79,7.91" target="#b64">Milgrom, Martin, and Negri, (1999)</ref>, who adapted the CWDC for treatment of postpartum depression. As well, participants were taught to implement the strategies in the context of parent-child interactions. The intervention was shortened to eight from 12 sessions because of the difficulty of maintaining engagement over longer periods <ref type="bibr" coords="2,521.62,231.04,20.95,7.91;2,306.00,242.04,115.23,7.91" target="#b9">(Christensen, Griffiths, &amp; Farrer, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In our administration of Mom-Net, initiation of the intervention is preceded by a brief motivational interview (MI; <ref type="bibr" coords="2,492.53,264.04,49.82,7.91;2,306.00,275.04,40.57,7.91" target="#b67">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002)</ref>.

Participants in both conditions were provided with a computer, printer, and Internet access. Participants in both conditions participated in a preintervention, inhome motivational interview. Sixty-nine of 70 participants completed posttest assessments. Participants assigned to the Mom-Net condition were highly engaged, completing an average of 6.37 out of 8 sessions (SD ϭ 2.56, median ϭ 8.00) with 63% completing the entire intervention. They participated in an average of 6.70 coach calls (SD ϭ 2.11).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>Though the efficacy trial demonstrated high levels of engagement, satisfaction, and efficacy, it was conducted with a small sample and under the tightly controlled conditions typical of initial efficacy tests. In particular, to provide equal access to the technology, computers and Internet connections were supplied to all participants, the coaches who provided phone support were research staff, and initial recruitment and MI sessions were conducted via home visits to participants. These conditions likely facilitated recruitment and retention of participants, as well as ease and fidelity of treatment delivery. Additionally, as only one-third of the DI/TAU participants accessed services in the community, the control condition was less rigorous than desired. This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>The goal of the current project, therefore, was to evaluate Mom-Net intervention effects within a larger trial under conditions that were more rigorous and closer (though not identical) to those of real-world service providers and recipients. As well, because one of the advantages of Internet delivery is to overcome access barriers, participant recruitment included rural areas. To this end, the current investigation is different in several ways from the initial trial. First, in the initial trial, coach contact was not provided for participants in the DI/TAU condition, and hence, we could not rule out the possibility that greater improvement for those in the Mom-Net condition was because of the effect of supportive attention from research staff. Thus, in the current investigation, participants in the comparison condition received biweekly calls from research staff who used an MI approach to facilitate engagement in services or other behavioral change activities. Second, to approximate real-world conditions, (a) coaching sessions for those in the Mom-Net condition were conducted by therapists employed by a not-for-profit agency providing community mental health services; (b) participants were not provided Internet access or gifted computers, though a small number (n ϭ 6) accessed the program through laptops borrowed from the mental health agency; and (c) the MI preceding the intervention for both conditions was conducted by phone rather than in a home visit.</p></div>

To be screened in as meeting criteria for major or minor depression, participants had to endorse either the depressed mood or anhedonia symptoms at the level of at least "more than half the days," report impairment in social functioning, and endorse a total of five symptoms (for major depressive disorder) or two symptoms (for minor depressive disorder) at the level of at least "more than half the days" on the PHQ-8. Presence of a full scale diagnosed maternal depressive disorder was not a prerequisite for inclusion given evidence that elevated maternal depressive symptoms are associated with parenting difficulties and higher risk for adverse child outcomes regardless of diagnostic status <ref type="bibr" coords="3,235.66,660.04,52.39,7.91;3,48.00,671.04,18.64,7.91" target="#b58">(Lovejoy et al., 2000)</ref>.

Informed consent information and questionnaires were collected by mail. Diagnostic interviews and motivational interviews were completed by phone by research staff. Randomization was accomplished by placing allocations in sealed envelopes that were shuffled before assignment. Research staff was blind to condition during the diagnostic interview and up until the point in the MI in which treatment options were discussed, at which point, staff opened the envelope containing the condition assignment. Postassessments were conducted after the intervention period (T2; 26.2 weeks after T1); interviewers conducting the diagnostic interviews were blind to condition. Participants were compensated for each assessment. <ref type="figure" coords="3,481.72,514.79,31.42,7.91" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> presents the participant flow diagram, utilizing Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interventions</head><p>A motivational interview was conducted before intervention with participants in both conditions. During the interview, staff provided feedback from the initial depression screener and explored how depressive symptoms impacted the participants' life, the participants' desire for change, prior change efforts, and impediments or ambivalence about addressing depressive symptoms. The interviewer then encouraged the participant to make a decision as to whether participating in the project as a way to address depressive symptoms was desirable to them at current time. For participants in the Mom-Net condition, the MI ended with a brief role induction that outlined what to expect from the intervention and the behaviors on the part of the client that were recommended for a successful experience.

In Mom-Net, the scaffolding was provided via immediate feedback from the computer program as well as by the coach. Another key structural feature was the use of varied multimedia materials and interactive elements to maintain participant engagement. We developed a competency-based approach in which knowledge acquisition was examined at the completion of each session. The goal was to achieve mastery (i.e., 80% correct responses) before the user proceeded to the next module. The program identifies incorrect responses, reviews related content, and retests the material, as needed. Most text elements are accompanied by corresponding audio and the remaining elements have optional narration to reduce literacy requirements.

Reluctance or barriers to engaging in the intervention were addressed within the MI framework, with coaches making reflective statements, emphasizing positive statements, helping mothers to identify if goals had changed, and problem-solving ways to meet their goals. Coaching was facilitated by an online infrastructure that provided coaches and supervisors with tools for monitoring client progress and participation. An administrative web page enabled coaches to: (a) monitor participation, understanding, and clinical progress (i.e., program utilization, homework completion, mood/activity ratings, content mastery, and biweekly depression ratings); and (b) tailor content of coach calls based on the information provided. The infrastructure also allowed mothers to connect with coaches in crisis situations via an online crisis link, which alerted coaches and supervisors via an immediate text message.</p><p>Motivational interviewing and referral to services.

As noted earlier, participants in the MIRS condition participated in the MI engagement interview at the conclusion of the preintervention assessment. Research staff then provided mothers with information about, and referrals to, community providers who serve low-income individuals. Research staff offered to initiate contact with the treatment provider to make an initial appointment. Participants also received biweekly motivational calls from a research staff who served as a coach during the 4-month intervention period. These calls lasted an average of 20.4 min. Working within an MI framework, the coach: (a) checked in with mothers about the concerns they had raised in the initial motivational interview; (b) queried as to what mothers were doing to seek/engage in mental health services and to otherwise improve their mood; and (c) used reflective statements to emphasize mothers' change statements. They also administered the PHQ-9 for safety monitoring. Research staff doing the MIRS coaching consisted of two bachelors level and one doctoral level nonclinical staff, trained in the use of MI skills. Training and ongoing supervision was provided by a research supervisor who was a masters level clinician.</p><p>Provision of MI calls to mothers was intended to have two effects.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Mom-Net is coach-facilitated, Internet-delivered CBT intervention comprised of both online tutorials and coach phone calls corresponding to each session. It was developed for and targeted to low-income mothers of young children, as a population at greatly increased vulnerability to depressive conditions. In this RCT, the Mom-Net intervention was administered in a community mental health center by community-based bachelor-and masters-level clinicians. Because motivational deficits can be a barrier to participation in depressed populations, participation in both conditions was preceded by a brief motivational interview aimed at promoting community-based resources as well as engagement and active participation in the Mom-Net intervention. It was compared with an alternative intervention condition that received facilitated referrals to community treatment providers as well as biweekly phone contact with a coach. As discussed, phone calls in the control conditions used an MI framework and were intended to facilitate engagement in community mental health services and provide social support as a control for that provided by the Mom-Net coaches.</p><p>With regard to engagement and participation, it is important to note that 30% of participants never initiated program use. It is possible that as the sample was recruited, which is to say, not treatment seeking, that motivation to participate in research may have exceeded motivation for treatment engagement. It is also likely that there are barriers to engagement that were not sufficiently addressed by either our initial motivational interview or ongoing coach support. Nonetheless, these rates are similar to others reported in the literature for both online and in person interventions <ref type="bibr" coords="8,98.12,671.04,93.72,7.91" target="#b46">(Kaltenthaler et al., 2008)</ref>. Identifying factors associated with nonengagement is an important focus of ongoing research.</p><p>Notably, however, among participants who initiated use, participation in the program was high. On average, participants who initiated the program (70% of Mom-Net participants) completed 80% of sessions, with more that 70% completing all sessions. Additionally, they completed more than 85% of expected coach calls. As well, participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the program, indicating that they found the intervention helpful, the website easy to use, and the coaches to be supportive. Overall these indices of engagement and satisfaction are comparable with those of other Internet interventions <ref type="bibr" coords="8,326.85,315.76,94.78,7.91" target="#b9">(Christensen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,424.27,315.76,93.77,7.91" target="#b46">Kaltenthaler et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,520.67,315.76,25.38,7.91;8,306.00,326.85,63.66,7.91" target="#b92">Waller &amp; Gilbody, 2009</ref>). By means of comparison, Waller and Gilbody (2009) have reported in a systematic review of computerized CBT that on average 56% of participants complete the full course of intervention.</p><p>Turning to effectiveness, the results were very promising. Participants in the Mom-Net condition demonstrated significantly greater reduction in depression as indexed by self-report questionnaire (primary outcome), interviewer-rated symptoms, and diagnostic outcomes. The effect sizes obtained in the current study are comparable with the overall effect size of d ϭ .28 for the 18 CWDC treatment studies included in the meta-analytic review conducted by <ref type="bibr" coords="8,362.73,448.85,120.08,7.91">Cuijpers and colleagues (2009)</ref>. Moreover, the within group effects for the Mom-Net condition were large, mirroring those obtained in our earlier tightly controlled pilot trial <ref type="bibr" coords="8,306.00,482.12,78.36,7.91" target="#b85">(Sheeber et al., 2012)</ref>. These effects are notable for a number of reasons. As described, economically disadvantaged mothers of young children experience depressive conditions at high rates <ref type="bibr" coords="8,306.00,515.39,71.44,7.91" target="#b59">(Malik et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,380.43,515.39,85.93,7.91" target="#b60">McLennan et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,469.34,515.39,76.71,7.91;8,306.00,526.49,19.37,7.91" target="#b95">Weissman &amp; Jensen, 2002)</ref>, resulting in suffering and impairment for themselves and their children. Moreover, evidence suggests that they are unlikely to access traditionally offered services <ref type="bibr" coords="8,448.09,548.67,70.35,7.91" target="#b93">(Wang et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,521.07,548.67,20.83,7.91;8,306.00,559.76,78.22,7.91" target="#b95">Weissman &amp; Jensen, 2002)</ref>. The current project is important in that it speaks to the feasibility of remotely delivered interventions, which have the potential to overcome barriers to access for this at-risk population. In particular, it speaks to the plausibility of using Internet technology in low income and rural households. The replication of our earlier findings is also significant. This study improved on the initial pilot work <ref type="bibr" coords="8,446.54,626.30,85.49,7.91" target="#b85">(Sheeber et al., 2012)</ref> by providing a more robust control condition, eliminating researchspecific supports (e.g., provision of computer and Internet), and shifting the coaching to community-based therapists, rather than research staff. The significant effects, in this context, suggest the potential disseminability of the intervention for community-based delivery. This will be an important direction for future research.</p><p>It is worth noting, as well, that the effect size for betweengroups comparisons was modest, reflecting the beneficial impact This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

The large effect may be attributable, in part, to the fact that a sizable percentage of participants accessed services in the community. It may also reveal the beneficial impact of the support provided by the coaches. These effects are notable as the intervention was less intensive than the Mom-Net condition, including fewer and shorter coach calls and no structured intervention. As noted earlier, the MIRS condition shared features consistent with emerging patient navigation strategies for chronic conditions, whose goals are to reduce health disparities experienced by vulnerable populations <ref type="bibr" coords="9,233.09,187.04,54.97,7.91;9,48.00,198.04,46.83,7.91" target="#b71">(Natale-Pereira et al., 2011)</ref>. The combination of MI, referrals, and ongoing monitoring and support, appears to have been highly beneficial to participants. A question could be raised regarding the extent to which coach support is necessary for treatment effects. As described earlier, existing research suggests that treatment effects are typically stronger for Internet interventions supplemented by human support. Supported interventions, moreover, evidence both better program adherence <ref type="bibr" coords="9,87.38,286.04,70.19,7.91" target="#b69">(Mohr et al., 2013)</ref> and stronger effects than nonsupported interventions <ref type="bibr" coords="9,131.76,297.04,98.61,7.91" target="#b2">(Andersson et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,235.74,297.04,52.29,7.91;9,48.00,308.04,57.67,7.91" target="#b3">Andersson &amp; Cuijpers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,107.95,308.04,78.01,7.91" target="#b17">Cuijpers et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,188.23,308.04,79.00,7.91" target="#b49">Kleiboer et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="9,269.50,308.04,18.54,7.91;9,48.00,319.04,45.30,7.91" target="#b86">Spek et al., 2007)</ref>. Nonetheless, one limitation of our design is that because the two components of the intervention were highly integrated (e.g., "Try this strategy and then discuss how it went with your coach"; "Make a plan and send it to your coach for review"), with both aspects designed to facilitate engagement and skill acquisition, the unique effects of each component cannot be determined. The extent of the integration reflects our conceptualization of the intervention as facilitating remote delivery of services rather than as a stand-alone intervention. That said, revising the tutorials so as to enable self-administration without coach support may be a useful direction for future research. Though effect sizes would likely be significantly lower <ref type="bibr" coords="9,72.54,451.04,114.41,7.91" target="#b3">(Andersson &amp; Cuijpers, 2009)</ref>, the public health benefit could be large given the potentially greater reach <ref type="bibr" coords="9,249.38,462.04,38.66,7.91;9,48.00,473.04,20.12,7.91" target="#b35">(Glasgow, 2007)</ref>, if attention to instructional design is successful in overcoming barriers to engagement and retention evident in unsupported programs <ref type="bibr" coords="9,113.84,495.03,95.84,7.91" target="#b9">(Christensen et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>There are, of course, limitations to discuss. First, these effects reflect the initial prepost outcomes, and do not speak to the extent to which effects are maintained over time. Subsequent analyses will address maintenance of treatment effects as the long-term follow-up data become available. As well, we will examine the extent to which results are mediated by hypothesized changes in cognitive-behavioral mechanisms. Second, because the sample was relatively homogeneous with regard to demographic characteristics and included a large percentage who had attended some college, we do not know how the intervention would have fared in a more diverse sample, though meta-analyses on the CWDC indicate that its effectiveness is robust across diverse populations . Third, to minimize participant burden, we limited the number of outcomes and did not assess comorbid psychopathology. Hence, the effect of comorbid psychopathology on the effectiveness of the Mom-Net intervention awaits future research. As well, our focus here was on diagnostic outcomes, and we did not include broader indices of well-being such as quality of life measures. Fourth, mothers were included based on the PHQ-9 screener and approximately one-third of the sample did not meet DSM-IV criteria for a depressive diagnosis at pretest based on the SCID interview. However, the CWDC has been shown to be effective for preventing escalation to full syndrome among individuals with subthreshold depression .</p><p>Additional directions for future work are also worth noting. At this stage in the program of research, it makes sense to turn our attention to questions of implementation and sustainability <ref type="bibr" coords="9,526.57,143.03,15.59,7.91;9,306.00,154.03,158.45,7.91" target="#b20">(Curran, Bauer, Mittman, Pyne, &amp; Stetler, 2012)</ref>. Reach is also important: are there nonclinical community sites serving low income families, such as Head Start programs, who would be natural partners for the delivery of the Mom-Net intervention? Moreover, given that younger and lower income persons differentially access the Internet through mobile devices, it will be critical to adapt the intervention for these delivery systems <ref type="bibr" coords="9,459.24,220.03,86.82,7.91;9,306.00,231.03,19.37,7.91">(Pew Research Center, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In closing, the Mom-Net intervention appears to be feasible and effective, as a remotely delivered treatment for economically disadvantaged mothers. Relative to coach-supported, facilitated usual care, it demonstrated significant effects on multiple indices of depressive outcomes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="5,117.00,524.20,360.02,7.03;5,117.00,534.20,258.14,7.03"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>This flow diagram, utilizing Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) guidelines, depicts the numbers of participants at each assessment, and allocation to study conditions.</figDesc></figure>
