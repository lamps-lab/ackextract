<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>A strong sense of community has been associated with improved wellbeing, increased feelings of safety and security, participation in community affairs and civic responsibility. Although interest in how the broader built environment influences sense of community is gaining momentum, there is a dearth of empirical research examining the association between sense of community and the quality of public space. This study investigates the relationship between four public spaces e Public Open Space (POS), community centres, schools and shops e and sense of community in residents of new housing developments in the Perth metropolitan area, Western Australia. Data was obtained from a cross-sectional survey (n ¼ 911), a POS audit, and Geographical Information Systems, and analysed using linear regression. The perceived quality of neighbourhood POS and shops was significantly and positively associated with sense of community. This relationship appears to be unaffected by how frequently people use these spaces. High quality public spaces may be important settings for enhancing sense of community within residents of new housing developments.</p></div>

Sense of community is often defined as "a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their commitment to be together" <ref type="bibr" coords="1,154.66,519.92,114.16,7.54">(McMillan &amp; Chavis, 1986, p. 9</ref>). This emphasis on affiliation and belonging has been used to distinguish sense of community from other place constructs. For example, place attachment has been identified with emotional bonding and behavioural commitment, while place dependence has been tied to available activities and quality comparisons with other communities <ref type="bibr" coords="1,59.02,582.69,135.08,7.54" target="#b79">(Pretty, Chipuer, &amp; Bramston, 2003)</ref>.

Although there is undoubtedly theoretical and phenomenological overlap between the different place constructs, there are varied, and sometimes contradictory, definitions within the published literature. Recent years have seen a number of attempts to better define and interpret these constructs <ref type="bibr" coords="1,453.84,436.25,74.17,7.54" target="#b6">(Bow &amp; Buys, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,530.32,436.25,32.30,7.54;1,311.54,446.68,20.71,7.54" target="#b60">Lewicka, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,336.03,446.68,174.68,7.54" target="#b68">Mannarini, Tartaglia, Fedi, &amp; Greganti, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,514.56,446.68,48.02,7.54;1,311.54,457.17,20.11,7.54" target="#b79">Pretty et al., 2003)</ref>.

This reflects a focus on the social bonds within and between people and place, as well as the physical, symbolic, political and cultural implications of 'community' <ref type="bibr" coords="1,311.54,509.45,87.72,7.54" target="#b68">(Mannarini et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In this age of advanced technology and mobility, sense of community is not limited to a geographical region. However, the close proximity of neighbours provides unique opportunities for social interaction and support, such as collecting mail, watching children in emergencies, or surveillance of people's homes <ref type="bibr" coords="1,548.17,561.78,14.40,7.54;1,311.55,572.21,19.45,7.54" target="#b45">(Ife, 1995)</ref>. Furthermore, resources found within the neighbourhood, including neighbours, will always serve a function for less mobile residents such as people working from home, the elderly, parents of young children, single car households and the socio-economically disadvantaged <ref type="bibr" coords="1,369.03,614.11,125.08,7.54" target="#b59">(Kweon, Sullivan, &amp; Wiley, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,497.10,614.11,65.47,7.54;1,311.55,624.55,112.01,7.54" target="#b66">Maas, van Dillen, Verheij, &amp; Groenewegen, 2009</ref>). Ironically, as our awareness of the benefits of a strong sense of community grows, there are concerns that sense of community is declining throughout the Western world <ref type="bibr" coords="1,311.55,655.96,132.16,7.54" target="#b6">(Bonaiuto, Fornara, &amp; Bonnes, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,445.17,655.96,96.34,7.54" target="#b84">Scopelliti &amp; Giuliani, 2004)</ref>. This decline is attributed to a variety of reasons, including smaller family networks, suburbanisation, longer commutes, the prolonged independence of an ageing population, and the proliferation of leisuretime television and social media use <ref type="bibr" coords="1,467.48,697.76,64.48,7.54" target="#b31">(Freeman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,537.06,697.76,25.53,7.54;1,311.54,708.19,99.57,7.54" target="#b43">House, Landis, &amp; Umberson, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="1,413.19,708.19,62.82,7.54" target="#b73">Oldenburg, 1989)</ref>.</p><p>Identifying and creating the conditions that foster and strengthen sense of community within residential neighbourhoods is an important task for researchers and planners alike. In terms of the built environment, a stronger sense of community has been associated with less surface parking, higher levels of commercial floor space to land area ratios, lower levels of land use mix <ref type="bibr" coords="2,256.48,119.04,27.43,7.54;2,32.84,129.53,96.15,7.54" target="#b97">(Wood, Frank, &amp; Giles-Corti, 2010)</ref>, and living in neighbourhoods perceived as safe and interesting <ref type="bibr" coords="2,128.18,139.96,48.41,7.54" target="#b64">(Lund, 2002)</ref>.

There are many definitions of public space within the published literature. 'True' public space is recognised as being accessible to all groups, providing freedom of action, temporary claim and ownership <ref type="bibr" coords="2,77.28,234.14,89.35,7.54" target="#b2">(Altman &amp; Zube, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,170.14,234.14,113.76,7.54;2,32.83,244.57,19.81,7.54" target="#b14">Carr, Francis, Rivlin, &amp; Stone, 1992)</ref>. In contemporary society however, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between public and private space <ref type="bibr" coords="2,255.99,255.06,27.89,7.54;2,32.82,265.50,20.53,7.54" target="#b93">(Voyce, 2006)</ref>. Indeed, many definitions of public space are said to be "too narrow to be useful in an era of publiceprivate partnerships" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,32.81,286.47,104.17,7.54">(Smithsimon, 1999, p. 2)</ref>. Government-owned lands cannot always be accessed by the public, while privately owned and controlled land often appears to have public character <ref type="bibr" coords="2,255.95,307.39,27.80,7.54;2,32.81,317.83,20.53,7.54" target="#b93">(Voyce, 2006)</ref>. Thus, locations that constitute public space vary along a continuum ranging from public to private, and can be categorised according to concepts of ownership, management and accessibility <ref type="bibr" coords="2,83.10,349.24,104.96,7.54" target="#b72">(Nemeth &amp; Schmidt, 2007)</ref>. Ray Oldenburg coined the term "third places" to describe "a generic designation for a great variety of public places that host the regular, voluntary, informal and happily anticipated gatherings of individuals beyond the realms of home and work" <ref type="bibr" coords="2,188.26,391.08,92.07,7.54">(Oldenburg, 1989, p. 16)</ref>. The definition of public space adopted for this study was informed by Oldenburg's description of third places e i.e., the meeting or gathering places that exist outside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the public, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and proximity. The emphasis of this definition is on public access, rather than public ownership or management, although e as exemplified above e both the uses and users are always limited <ref type="bibr" coords="2,93.68,485.20,74.22,7.55" target="#b87">(Smithsimon, 1999)</ref>. Thus, public space includes parks, plazas, sidewalks, shopping malls, community centres and schoolyards <ref type="bibr" coords="2,85.05,506.08,99.45,7.54" target="#b2">(Altman &amp; Zube, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,191.40,506.08,74.02,7.54" target="#b14">Carr et al., 1992)</ref>. In particular, this study focuses on common places of interaction within the neighbourhood e parks, shops, community centres and schoolyards.</p><p>While investigations into public places and concepts are the mainstay of environmental psychology, there are few published articles within the public health literature that refer to 'public space' per se and not individual locations such as parks or community centres. Of the four public spaces relevant to this study, parks have been most frequently investigated, although generally in relation to physical activity rather than social interaction or sense of community. In contrast, a number of architects, urban designers, and sociologists have long investigated public space attributes that facilitate social interaction <ref type="bibr" coords="2,137.44,642.10,66.97,7.54" target="#b14">(Carr et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,207.63,642.10,53.64,7.54" target="#b29">Francis, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,264.49,642.10,19.40,7.54;2,32.84,652.59,22.17,7.54" target="#b33">Gehl, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,58.41,652.59,49.62,7.54" target="#b46">Jacobs, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,111.41,652.59,48.20,7.54">Lynch, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,163.00,652.59,49.27,7.54" target="#b95">Whyte, 1980)</ref>. As well as physical environmental features, such as seating, food, shelter, people, and activities, urban designers and architects often refer to more subjective qualities when describing successful public spaces. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,69.75,694.43,64.69,7.54" target="#b14">Carr et al. (1992)</ref> note that good public space should be supportive, democratic and meaningful, and address basic human needs, such as comfort, passive and active engagement, and discovery. Architect Jan Gehl also advocates the importance of designing public spaces for people and social interaction <ref type="bibr" coords="2,261.47,736.28,22.42,7.54;2,301.85,66.79,20.16,7.54" target="#b33">(Gehl, 2006)</ref>. While he identifies a number of important physical elements of public space, such as traffic reduction schemes, walking paths, seating and spatial qualities, he emphasises the importance of first defining why and how people use public space <ref type="bibr" coords="2,504.30,98.14,44.55,7.54" target="#b33">(Gehl, 2006)</ref>. Project for Public Spaces (PPS), an American organisation based on the work of William H. Whyte, describe successful, or high quality, spaces as those that address issues of accessibility, activity and use, comfort and image, and sociability. That is, they are easy to access and connected to the surrounding community; contain a range of activities for a variety of users; feel safe, clean, and attractive, with adequate seating; and most importantly, act as venues for people to interact socially (Project for Public Spaces, 2008). However, while these sources provide valuable insights into the design of vibrant public spaces, many of their recommendations are based on personal experiences, case studies, interviews and observations. Furthermore, data collection methods are not always described, making it difficult to generalise or reproduce findings. <ref type="bibr" coords="2,521.10,234.16,31.84,7.54;2,301.87,244.60,25.26,7.54" target="#b32">Frumkin (2003)</ref> suggests that in order to prompt public health action, many commonly cited recommendations for successful public places need to be supported by rigorous empirical evidence. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,324.61,276.01,228.28,7.54" target="#b26">Ewing, Handy, Brownson, Clemente, and Winston (2006)</ref> emphasise the need to test the qualities for active street life that are often presumed to be important.</p><p>Few studies have investigated the extent to which the association between public space and sense of community is also influenced by the frequency of public space use. Given passive, face-toface contact of repeated and increasing length is found to be one component of developing friendships <ref type="bibr" coords="2,443.19,349.21,57.70,7.60" target="#b39">(Halpern, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,502.64,349.21,50.24,7.54;2,301.83,359.64,90.37,7.54" target="#b58">Kuo, Sullivan, Coley, &amp; Brunson, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,395.03,359.64,51.80,7.54" target="#b61">Leyden, 2003)</ref>, the frequent use of public space is a plausible pathway through which public space influences chance encounters. Published studies have tended to examine associations between sense of community and features of public space such as proximity to the home, accessibility and surrounding land use diversity <ref type="bibr" coords="2,371.67,411.98,48.43,7.54" target="#b64">(Lund, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,422.64,411.98,78.70,7.54" target="#b71">Nasar &amp; Julian, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,503.89,411.98,48.95,7.54;2,301.83,422.41,21.27,7.54" target="#b77">Plas &amp; Lewis, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,327.12,422.41,106.76,7.54" target="#b96">Wilson &amp; Baldassare, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,437.90,422.41,71.59,7.54" target="#b97">Wood et al., 2010)</ref>. However, the mere existence of public space does not guarantee its use.

All Perth residents building homes in new housing developments between July 2003 and December 2005 were invited to participate. Eligible participants were proficient in English; aged 18 years or over; planning to move into their new home by December 2005; and willing to complete a survey and wear a pedometer for seven days on three occasions over four years. Study participants completed self-administered surveys before moving into their new home (T1; n ¼ 1813), and at 12 (T2; n ¼ 1379) and 36 months (T3; n ¼ 1230) later. The sense of community sample comprised 911 respondents who completed the T3 survey between October 2006 and June 2008. The study was approved by The University of Western Australia's Human Research Ethics Committee.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Data collection</head><p>A mixed-method approach was adopted, with data sources including a cross-sectional survey, a Public Open Space (POS) audit and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data. These instruments and data sources were informed by a comprehensive literature review, the opinions of an expert panel and focus groups with residents of RESIDE neighbourhoods. The expert panel comprised community developers, an urban geographer, a community psychologist, an environmental psychologist, a property developer, a local government representatives and academics.</p></div>

The survey instrument sought information about participants' psychosocial environment and use of public space, as well as neighbourhood and POS attributes.</p><p>2.2.1.1. Dependent variable. Sense of community was measured using the 12 item Sense of Community Index (SCI) <ref type="bibr" coords="3,235.90,736.30,57.77,7.54;3,311.53,296.41,116.68,7.54" target="#b16">(Chavis, Hogge, McMillan, &amp; Wandersman, 1986</ref>). The Index is specifically designed to measure sense of community within neighbourhoods, and is the most widely used measure of the concept <ref type="bibr" coords="3,475.08,317.33,87.49,7.54;3,311.53,327.77,20.11,7.54" target="#b78">(Pooley, Cohen, &amp; Pike, 2005)</ref>. The Internal Consistency Reliability of the SCI is high, with studies reporting a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.80 <ref type="bibr" coords="3,529.80,338.26,32.76,7.54;3,311.54,348.69,165.38,7.54" target="#b75">(Perkins, Florin, Rich, Wandersman, &amp; Chavis, 1990)</ref>. Participants responded true or false to 12 statements concerning their neighbourhood before responses were summed to provide an overall score ranging between 0 and 12. The distribution of the data was assessed, with low (score 0e6), medium (score 7e9) and high (score 10e12) categories assigned to ensure a sufficient number of respondents in each category.</p><p>2.2.1.2. Independent self-reported variables. The four public spaces chosen for this study were based on the results of formative focus groups, in which participants identified POS, shops, community centres and schools as the most common sites for social interaction within the neighbourhood. Of the independent self-reported variables, physical environmental variables included subjective proximity and quality of the four public spaces. Subjective quality was measured by asking participants the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements about their local POS, shop, community centre and school. Statements addressed the atmosphere, comfort, safety, attractiveness and maintenance, the variety of things to do, and the presence of adequate seating, public art and other people (including those known to the participant). After factor analysis, these items were summed to create an overall score, which was dichotomised into low and high quality.</p><p>Social environmental variables included whether participants agreed there was a high level of crime in the neighbourhood, and participation in neighbourhood groups or activities during the last 12 months (i.e. school or work, service, art or cultural, sport or recreation and neighbouring).</p><p>Public space 'use' variables included frequency of public space use and mode of POS use. The frequency with which participants used public space was measured by asking participants how often they used these spaces, with 'frequent' use defined as at least once a week, and 'infrequent' as less than once a week. 'Mode of POS use' was measured by asking participants if they used POS to undertake 14 activities. Factor analysis reduced the activities to five underlying dimensions (i.e., 'watch or play sport', 'attend an event', 'walk or jog', 'relax' and 'other activities'). Demographic variables included gender, age, marital status, children less than 18 years at home, education, work status, number of hours worked and area-level socio-economic status. Socio-Economic Status (SES) was measured using education as a proxy for individual SES and the 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics' Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) score (ABS, 2008a) as area-level SES. SEIFA scores were based on the combined Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage (ABS, 2008b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sense of Community</head><p>2.2.1.3. Independent objective variables. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to obtain POS size, the number of public spaces within a study participant's neighbourhood, and the network distances (i.e., the road or pedestrian networks) between participants' homes and their closest public space. 'Neighbourhood' was defined as a 10e15 min walk from the participants' home. For objective environmental data, a 1600 m road network buffer was used to capture the neighbourhood within a 10e15 min walk .</p><p>The objective quality of public space measure was based on an audit of approximately 1900 public open spaces (i.e., parks, recreational grounds, sports fields, commons, esplanades and bushland) within the Perth and Peel metropolitan areas between November 2005 and February 2006. All POS ! two acres, and within 1600 m of participants' homes, were audited by trained assessors using an adapted version of the Public Open Space Tool (POST) <ref type="bibr" coords="4,239.82,328.32,44.06,7.54;4,32.84,338.75,21.27,7.54" target="#b9">(Broomhall, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,58.01,338.75,89.72,7.54" target="#b35">Giles-Corti et al., 2005)</ref>.

A detailed description is reported elsewhere <ref type="bibr" coords="4,111.07,412.00,66.40,7.54" target="#b9">(Broomhall, 1996)</ref>. In addition to the quality score, an incivilities score was created reflecting the presence of litter, graffiti and vandalism within POS, while an amenities score reflected the presence of amenities conducive to social interaction, such as barbecues, seating, picnic tables, rubbish bins, club rooms, toilets and public art.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Analyses</head><p>Data analyses were undertaken using SPSS Version 15. General Linear Models were used to examine the demographic, social environmental, use of public space and physical environmental factors relating to sense of community. The impact of participants clustering within residential developments was assessed using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) estimation, and subsequently deemed unnecessary.</p><p>Demographic factors were individually assessed in univariate models <ref type="table" coords="4,64.64,589.81,33.61,7.54" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. All other variables were initially individually assessed after adjustment for potential confounding by all demographic variables. All physical environmental variables with p 0.1 in the single factor models were then entered into a multivariate model that also included forced entry of demographic variables. A backwards stepwise elimination procedure (p 0.05) was used to remove the redundant variables, thereby identifying the significant and independent correlates of sense of community. This strategy was repeated for the remaining blocks of variables (i.e., social environmental and use of public space).</p><p>Finally, a series of multivariate models were fitted to examine the relationship between sense of community and the selected physical environmental factors. The first of these models included all physical environmental factors after adjustment for demographic variables only (Model 1). The second model further adjusted for the selected social environmental variables (Model 2), while the third model further adjusted for the selected use of public space variables (Model 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>The mean sense of community score for the sample of 911 participants was 8.59 (SD 2.46). Of the eight demographic factors examined, univariate analyses indicated that mean sense of community was higher in participants who were married or defacto, had children less than 18 years at home, were employed in home duties and were not in the workforce <ref type="table" coords="4,478.37,558.42,32.83,7.54" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. Although there is suggestion of higher mean sense of community in people with a Bachelor degree or higher (p ¼ 0.063), the overall p-value for education was not significant (p ¼ 0.114). While the multivariate models forced the inclusion of the eight demographic factors, none remained significantly associated with sense of community in the multivariate models.</p><p>Of the seven physical environmental factors included in the univariate models, sense of community was significantly associated with subjective distance to closest park and school (negative associations), and with subjective quality of parks, community centres shops and schools (positive associations). As shown in <ref type="table" coords="4,301.86,683.95,27.70,7.54" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> (Model 1), these remained significant in the multivariate model resulting from the variable reduction strategy (and having adjusted for demographics). Mean sense of community was higher in those who lived less than 5 min from their park (p ¼ 0.22) and who reported high rather than low quality of public space (p &lt; 0.001). However, only subjective distance to closest POS, and  the subjective quality of a local POS and shop, remained significantly associated with sense of community in multivariate Model 2 ( <ref type="table" coords="6,36.63,87.69,27.36,7.54" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>). The relationship between sense of community and subjective POS and shop quality attenuated in Model 3, but remained highly significant (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively). Participants who claimed to live 5e15 min from POS reported weaker sense of community than those living closer to POS, even after adjustment for POS use (p ¼ 0.02). Nevertheless, this relationship attenuated in Model 3 suggesting the relationship between POS proximity and sense of community is partly explained by the fact POS is used for a variety of purposes involving social interactions. The objective measure of POS was not significantly associated with sense of community at any stage of the analysis. Subjective and objective measures of POS quality were significantly, but only modestly, correlated (R ¼ 0.12; p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Of the six social environmental factors that emerged as significant in the univariate analysis, all but involvement in sport or recreation activities remained significant in the multivariate models arising from the backward elimination process. Only perceived neighbourhood crime and involvement in school or work and neighbouring activities remained significantly associated with sense of community in Model 3, with mean sense of community scores higher in participants' who disagreed that there was a high level of crime in the neighbourhood and who were involved in one or more activities ( <ref type="table" coords="6,105.64,328.32,27.98,7.54" target="#tab_1">Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>All nine POS use variables appeared significantly associated with sense of community in the univariate analyses, although frequent use of parks, frequent use of community centres, and usually using parks to walk or jog were removed in the backward elimination process. Using POS to relax was the only activity to remain significantly associated with sense of community in Model 3, with participants who usually used POS to relax demonstrating a slightly higher mean score (p &lt; 0.05). Frequent use of POS was not significantly associated with sense of community in the multivariate models, suggesting that it did not influence the relationship between POS quality and sense of community. It was not included in the final models <ref type="table" coords="6,106.77,453.85,31.76,7.54" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>This paper used a social-ecological framework to explore the potential correlates of sense of community in RESIDE study participants, emphasising the quality and attributes of public space. In particular, sense of community was significantly associated with the subjective quality of local shops and POS, as well as perceived distance to POS, after adjusting for a range of demographic, use of public space and social environmental factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Correlates of sense of community</head><p>The results support the study's premise that public space quality is an equally, if not more important, correlate of sense of community than public space size and number. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,185.61,642.09,98.27,7.54" target="#b98">Zhang and Lawson (2009)</ref> also found the size and number of public spaces outside residential buildings were not significantly associated with social interaction, concluding that the key to social interaction in public spaces was the quality of the public space provided <ref type="bibr" coords="6,188.84,683.93,87.00,7.54" target="#b98">(Zhang &amp; Lawson, 2009</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Pathways between environmental correlates and sense of community</head><p>This study showed that the frequency with which people use POS and shops only explained a small portion of the relationship between POS or shop quality and sense of community. As direct associations between POS or shop quality and sense of community were observed, this study may indicate that as long as people visit public space, the frequency with which they do so does not influence their sense of community. By contrast, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,402.47,160.90,59.52,7.54" target="#b58">Kuo et al. (1998)</ref> found that the relationship between green space and social ties was mediated by the use of common space in an inner-city housing development. Using the same study setting, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,386.02,192.31,72.86,7.54" target="#b59">Kweon et al. (1998)</ref> found that use of the space predicted the strength of neighbourhood social ties and sense of community in older adults. A direct relationship has also been found between sense of community and residents' use of natural and semideveloped areas, such as playgrounds and ball fields <ref type="bibr" coords="7,502.13,234.15,56.46,7.54" target="#b52">(Kearney, 2006)</ref>. However, as views of nature from the home also predicted sense of community, Kearney concluded that people may benefit from shared nature spaces without physically using them. Other studies found significant associations between green space and supportive interactions were less to do with actual contacts with neighbours than green space's ability to strengthen sense of community via place attachment and identity within its residents <ref type="bibr" coords="7,485.38,307.40,77.19,7.54" target="#b59">(Kweon et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,311.52,317.84,61.81,7.54" target="#b66">Maas et al., 2009)</ref>. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the role of frequent shop visits in the relationship between shop quality and sense of community.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Study limitations</head><p>As a cross-sectional study, one cannot determine whether high quality public space strengthens sense of community, or if people with a stronger sense of community rate quality higher. People who spend more time in public spaces may also view them more favourably. Indeed, people with larger social networks have been said to visit shops more frequently as a result of their numerous social engagements, emphasis on personal appearance, and subsequent desire to purchase new clothes and beauty products <ref type="bibr" coords="7,311.52,464.29,90.94,7.54" target="#b22">(Crask &amp; Reynolds, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,404.09,464.29,97.01,7.54" target="#b44">Hyun-Mee &amp; Miller, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,502.80,464.29,55.85,7.54" target="#b63">Lumpkin, 1985)</ref>. Longitudinal studies are also needed to clarify whether more affluent study participants have greater control over where they live. As more advantaged socio-economic suburbs have been shown to contain higher quality parks <ref type="bibr" coords="7,461.82,506.13,84.68,7.55" target="#b23">(Crawford et al., 2008)</ref>, all analyses within this study adjusted for individual and area-level socio-economic status.</p><p>This study has focused on subjective measures of public space quality, although an objective measure of POS quality was also included. Given the limitations of self-administered surveys, such as the potential for recall bias, future studies would benefit from objective measures of other public spaces, such as community centres, shops and schools <ref type="bibr" coords="7,422.25,589.77,59.92,7.54" target="#b83">(Schwarz, 1999)</ref>. In addition to the presence of various public space features, new measures of quality should also consider the condition of these features <ref type="bibr" coords="7,507.97,610.69,54.61,7.54;7,311.53,621.18,44.32,7.54" target="#b3">(Bedimo-Rung et al., 2005)</ref>. Objective measures of public space quality can also help to tease out those tacit features of public space that users appreciate, but are not necessarily aware of. For example, <ref type="bibr" coords="7,526.68,642.10,35.89,7.54;7,311.53,652.59,118.24,7.54" target="#b13">Carmona, Heath, Oc, and Tiesdell (2010)</ref> note that an important aspect of public space quality is visual and physical permeability e that is, the ability to both move through an environment and see the routes available to them <ref type="bibr" coords="7,380.07,683.94,82.03,7.54" target="#b13">(Carmona et al., 2010)</ref>. Studies into the configuration of space, i.e. space syntax, may also assist in this regard <ref type="bibr" coords="7,311.54,704.86,51.08,7.54" target="#b41">(Hillier, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,365.11,704.86,163.90,7.54" target="#b41">Hillier, Penn, Hanson, Gajewski, &amp; Xu, 1993)</ref>.</p><p>The value that different ethnic cultures place on public space and sense of community also warrants further investigation. While home ownership, length of residence and ethnicity were potentially confounding variables of the association between physical environmental variables and sense of community, these variables could not be included in the analyses as study participants were all home owners, had been living in their homes for approximately the same amount of time, and the large majority (87%) were born in English-speaking countries.</p><p>As previously noted, while there have been a number of attempts to distinguish between the many place concepts found within the social research literature <ref type="bibr" coords="8,127.72,150.45,73.77,7.54" target="#b6">(Bow &amp; Buys, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,203.70,150.45,55.17,7.54" target="#b60">Lewicka, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,261.07,150.45,22.85,7.54;8,32.83,160.89,42.78,7.54" target="#b79">Pretty et al., 2003)</ref>, definitions and measures of these concepts are yet to be standardised. Collaborations between researchers and practitioners working in the fields of community psychology, environmental psychology, planning and public health may help clarify these concepts and prevent the duplication of research.</p><p>There is debate amongst researchers as to whether sense of community is best measured as a community or individual-level attribute <ref type="bibr" coords="8,69.34,234.14,87.19,7.54" target="#b17">(Chavis &amp; Pretty, 1999)</ref>. Typically it is measured at the individual level and interpreted accordingly <ref type="bibr" coords="8,202.06,244.57,81.84,7.54;8,32.83,255.06,60.16,7.54" target="#b8">(Brodsky, O'Campo, &amp; Aronson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,98.94,255.06,94.04,7.54" target="#b91">Townley &amp; Kloos, 2009</ref>). This has been the approach adopted in this study. However, researchers have also argued that sense of community should be viewed as an ecological attribute and, as such, measured as an aggregated, communitylevel characteristic <ref type="bibr" coords="8,111.92,296.91,44.40,7.54" target="#b40">(Hill, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,161.76,296.91,122.13,7.54;8,32.83,307.39,19.45,7.54" target="#b62">Lochner, Kawachi, &amp; Kennedy, 1999)</ref>. Using multi-level statistical techniques to investigate the association between public space and sense of community at the community level may therefore be warranted. Researchers should also recognise, however, that the most valid ways of measuring collective attributes are yet to be determined <ref type="bibr" coords="8,203.82,349.24,76.19,7.54" target="#b62">(Lochner et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>This study has intentionally focused on the positive aspects of sense of community.

This is not to say that attempts to improve social outcomes in disadvantaged areas are unwarranted e high quality green spaces have been associated with fewer crimes, intra-family aggression and violence <ref type="bibr" coords="8,256.55,443.36,27.35,7.54;8,32.84,453.85,57.53,7.54" target="#b56">(Kuo &amp; Sullivan, 2001a</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,90.37,453.85,29.45,7.54" target="#b57">, 2001b</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Perceived quality of POS and shops appears to be strongly associated with sense of community. The presence of high quality public spaces in local neighbourhoods e irrespective of whether used frequently or not e may be important for enhancing sense of community amongst residents. Nevertheless, further research is needed to explore causation. The benefits of a strong sense of community are numerous, and potentially include increased participation in community affairs and better physical and mental health. Policies that support high quality public spaces are warranted.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="3,172.69,280.31,259.69,6.03"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Conceptual model of relationship between public space and sense of community.</figDesc></figure>
