Working with a data set of 10s of millions of Twitter messages (tweets), we used dictionary-based and open-vocabulary analyses to characterize the psychological language correlates of AHD mortality. We also gauged the amount of AHD-relevant information in Twitter language by building and evaluating predictive models of AHD mortality, and we compared the language models with traditional models that used demographic and socioeconomic risk factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We collected tweets from across the United States, determined their counties of origin, and derived values for language variables (e.g., the relative frequencies with which people expressed anger or engagement) for each county. We correlated these county-level language measures with county-level age-adjusted AHD mortality rates obtained from the CDC. To gauge the amount of information relevant to heart disease contained in the Twitter language, we compared the performance of prediction models that used Twitter language with the performance of models that contained county-level (a) measures of socioeconomic status (SES; i.e., income and education), (b) demographics (percentages of Black, Hispanic, married, and female residents), and (c) health variables (incidence of diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension). All procedures were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data sources</head><p>We used data from 1,347 U.S. counties for which AHD mortality rates; county-level socioeconomic, demographic, and health variables; and at least 50,000 tweeted words were available. More than 88% of the U.S. population lives in the included counties (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). 1</p><p>Twitter data. Tweets are brief messages (no more than 140 characters) containing information about emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and other personally salient information. In 2009 and 2010, Twitter made a 10% random sample of tweets (the "Garden Hose") available for researchers through direct access to its servers. We obtained a sample of 826 million tweets collected between June 2009 and March 2010. Many Twitter users self-reported their locations in their user profiles, and we used this information to map tweets to counties (for details, see the Mapping Tweets to Counties section of the Supplemental Method in the Supplemental Material available online). This resulted in 148 million countymapped tweets across 1,347 counties.</p><p>Heart disease data. Counties are the smallest socioecological level for which most CDC health variables and U.S. Census information are available. From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2010b) we obtained county-level age-adjusted mortality rates for AHD, which is represented by code I25.1 in the International Classification of Disease, 10th edition <ref type="bibr" coords="2,453.35,609.77,37.97,8.76">(ICD 10;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,496.29,609.77,58.72,8.76;2,310.50,621.77,84.47,8.76">World Health Organization, 1992)</ref>. This code has the highest overall mortality rate in the United States (prevalence = 51.5 deaths per 100,000 in 2010). We averaged AHD mortality rates across 2009 and 2010 to match the time period of the Twitter-language data set.</p><p>Demographic and health risk factors. We obtained county-level median income and the percentage of married residents from the American Community Survey (U.S. Census Bureau, 2009). We also obtained high school and college graduation rates from this survey, which we used to create an index of educational attainment. We obtained percentages of female, Black, and Hispanic residents from the U.S. Census Bureau (2010). From the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System of the Centers for Disease <ref type="bibr" coords="3,157.62,153.77,52.88,8.76">Control and</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,215.18,153.77,77.50,8.76;3,48.00,165.77,28.65,8.76">Prevention (2009, 2010a)</ref> we obtained prevalence of self-reported diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension (common cardiovascular risk factors) for which county-level estimates had previously been derived (see <ref type="table" coords="3,184.28,201.77,38.39,8.76" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref> in the Supplemental Tables of the Supplemental Material for detailed source information).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytic procedure</head><p>Language variables from Twitter. We used an automatic process to extract the relative frequency of words and phrases (sequences of two to three words) for every county. For example, the relative frequency of the word hate ranged from 0.009% to 0.139% across counties (see the Tokenization section of the Supplemental Method).</p><p>We then derived two more types of language-use variables from counties' relative word-usage frequencies: variables based on (a) dictionaries and (b) topics. Dictionary-based variables were relative frequencies of psychologically related words from predetermined dictionaries (e.g., positive-emotion words accounted for 4.6% of all words in a county on average). Topic-based variables were the relative usage of 2,000 automatically created topics, which are clusters of semantically related words that can be thought of as latent factors (words can have loadings on multiple topics; see the Topic Extraction section of the Supplemental Method).</p><p>We used preestablished dictionaries for anger, anxiety, positive and negative emotions, positive and negative social relationships, and engagement and disengagement <ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,525.77,116.03,8.76" target="#b29">(Pennebaker et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,170.39,525.77,122.32,8.76;3,48.00,537.77,138.95,8.76" target="#b40">Schwartz, Eichstaedt, Kern, Dziurzynski, Lucas, et al., 2013)</ref>.

To that end, we had human raters evaluate the dictionaries to determine whether each accurately measured the psychological concept intended. For each of the eight dictionaries, two independent raters examined 200 tweets containing dictionary words and rated whether each dictionary word in the tweets expressed the associated dictionary concept. A third rater was brought in to break ties. Judges rated the dictionaries to have accuracy levels between 55% and 89% (see <ref type="table" coords="3,519.11,81.77,35.88,8.76">Table S2</ref> in the <ref type="table" coords="3,338.50,93.77,95.30,8.76;3,433.80,92.46,3.25,5.69">Supplemental Tables). 2</ref> Statistical analysis. Dictionary and topic language variables were correlated with county AHD mortality rates using ordinary least squares linear regression. Each language variable was entered individually into the regression equation and then entered simultaneously with education and income as controls. We tested 2,000 topics, so we applied the Bonferroni correction to the significance threshold (i.e., for the correlation of 1 of 2,000 topics to be significant, its p value would have to be less than .05/2,000, or .000025).</p><p>Predictive models. A predictive model of county AHD mortality rates was created using all of the Twitter language variables. That is, we created a single model in which all of the word, phrase, dictionary, and topic frequencies were independent variables and the AHD mortality rate was the dependent variable. We used regularized linear regression (ridge regression) to fit the model (see the Predictive Models section of the Supplemental Method). We also created predictive models of county AHD mortality rates in which the predictors were different combinations of sets of variables: Twitter language, county demographics (percentages of Black, Hispanic, married, and female residents), and socioeconomic (income, education) and health (incidence of diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension) variables.</p><p>We avoided distorted results (due to model overfitting-picking up patterns simply by chance) by using a 10-fold cross-validation process that compared model predictions with out-of-sample data. For this analysis, the counties were first randomly partitioned into 10 parts (folds). Then, a predictive model was created by fitting the independent variables to the dependent variable (AHD mortality) over 9 of the 10 folds of counties (the training set). We then evaluated how well the resulting model predicted the outcomes for the remaining fold (one 10th of the counties; the hold-out set). We evaluated the model by comparing its predicted rates with the actual CDCreported mortality rates using a Pearson product-moment correlation. This procedure was repeated 10 times, allowing each fold to be the hold-out set. The results were averaged together to determine overall prediction performance across all counties for a given model.</p><p>To compare predictive performance between two models (e.g., a model based only on Twitter language versus a model based on income and education), we conducted paired t tests comparing the sizes of the standardized residuals of county-level predictions from the models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dictionaries</head><p>Greater usage of anger, negative-relationship, negativeemotion, and disengagement words was significantly correlated with greater age-adjusted AHD mortality (rs = .10-.17; for specific results, including confidence intervals, see <ref type="table" coords="4,88.02,477.51,30.66,8.76" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). After controlling for SES (income and education), all five negative language factors (including usage of anxiety words) were significant risk factors for AHD mortality (partial rs = .06, 95% confidence interval, or CI = [.00, .11], to .12, 95% CI = [.07, .17]). This suggests that Twitter language captures information not accounted for by SES. Greater use of positive-emotion and engagement words was associated with lower AHD mortality (r = −.11 and r = −.16, respectively). Use of engagement words remained significantly protective after controlling for SES (partial r = −.09, 95% CI = [−.14, −.04]), but use of positiveemotion words became only marginally significant (partial r = −.05, 95% CI = [−.00, −.11]). Usage of positive-relationships words 3 showed a nonsignificant association with AHD mortality (r = .02, 95% CI = [−.04, .07]; see <ref type="table" coords="4,254.72,645.51,29.95,8.76" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our study had three major findings. First, language expressed on Twitter revealed several community-level psychological characteristics that were significantly associated with heart-disease mortality risk. Second, use of negative-emotion (especially anger), disengagement, and negative-relationship language was associated with increased risk, whereas positive-emotion and engagement language was protective. Third, our predictive results suggest that the information contained in Twitter language fully accounts for-and adds to-the AHD-relevant information in 10 representatively assessed demographic, socioeconomic, and health variables. Taken together, our results suggest that language on Twitter can provide plausible indicators of community-level psychosocial health that may complement other methods of studying the impact of place on health used in epidemiology (cf. <ref type="bibr" coords="6,310.50,516.44,109.87,8.76" target="#b0">Auchincloss et al., 2012)</ref> and that these indicators are associated with risk for cardiovascular mortality.</p><p>Our findings point to a community-level psychological risk profile similar to risk profiles that have been observed at the individual level. County-level associations between AHD mortality and use of negative-emotion words (relative risk, 5 or RR, = 1.22), anger words (RR = 1.41), and anxiety words (RR = 1.11) were comparable to individual-level meta-analytic effect sizes for the association between AHD mortality and depressed mood (RR = 1.49; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,310.50,636.44,63.15,8.76" target="#b38">Rugulies, 2002)</ref>, anger (RR = 1.22; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,455.42,636.44,95.39,8.76" target="#b7">Chida &amp; Steptoe, 2009)</ref>, and anxiety (RR = 1.48; <ref type="bibr" coords="6,426.40,648.44,128.57,8.76;6,310.50,660.44,64.03,8.76" target="#b34">Roest, Martens, de Jonge, &amp; Denollet, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Although less is known at the individual level about the protective effects of positive psychological variables than about the risk associated with negative variables, our findings align with a growing body of research supporting the </p></div>

Use of positive-emotion words was also protective, which is in line with numerous findings that positive emotions convey protection from illness and disease (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="7,259.33,468.66,33.35,8.76;7,48.00,480.66,122.73,8.76" target="#b19">Howell, Kern, &amp; Lyubomirsky, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,175.19,480.66,113.21,8.76" target="#b32">Pressman &amp; Cohen, 2005)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" coords="7,48.00,492.66,221.95,8.76" target="#b15">Fredrickson, Mancuso, Branigan, and Tugade (2000)</ref> have argued that positive emotions may undo the negative cardiovascular aftereffects of anxiety-induced cardiovascular reactivity. Optimism has been shown to have relatively robust association with reduced risk of cardiovascular events at the individual level <ref type="bibr" coords="7,171.89,552.66,120.60,8.76" target="#b1">(Boehm &amp; Kubzansky, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="7,48.00,564.66,101.15,8.76" target="#b6">Chida &amp; Steptoe, 2008)</ref>. We did not have a predefined optimism dictionary, but our topic analyses seem to have identified this as a protective factor (as indicated by results for topics containing opportunities, goals, overcome; <ref type="figure" coords="7,78.08,612.66,65.05,8.76">Fig. 1, bottom)</ref>. This demonstrates the value of data-driven language analyses. Overall, our topic findings were similar to and converged with our theory-based dictionary results (cross-correlations are given in <ref type="table" coords="7,97.82,660.66,150.09,8.76">Table S3 in the Supplemental Tables)</ref>. Although theory-based analyses can be more easily tied to existing literature, topic analyses provide a richer portrait of specific behaviors and attitudes (e.g., cursing, frustration, being tired) that correspond to broad psychological characteristics (e.g., anger or stress) associated with an increased risk for AHD mortality. Data-driven analyses, such as our topic analyses, may help identify novel psychological, social, and behavioral correlates of disease.</p><p>When analyses use theory-based dictionaries, results can be driven by a few frequent but ambiguous words. For example, greater use of words in the original positive-relationships dictionary <ref type="bibr" coords="7,434.07,468.66,121.14,8.76;7,310.50,480.66,148.81,8.76" target="#b41">(Schwartz, Eichstaedt, Kern, Dziurzynski, Ramones, et al., 2013)</ref> was surprisingly associated with increased risk, as was the use of its most frequent word, love. Love accounted for more than a third of the total usage of the positive-relationships dictionary (5.3 million occurrences of love compared with 15.0 million occurrences of all words in the dictionary), which means that love drove the results for this dictionary. Reading through a random sample of tweets containing love revealed them to be mostly statements about loving things, not people. 6 Excluding love from the dictionary reduced the correlation between use of the words in the positive-relationships dictionary and AHD mortality (r = .08, 95% CI = [.03, .13]) to nonsignificance (r = .02, 95% CI = [−.04, .07]).</p><p>These results demonstrate the pitfalls of interpreting dictionary-based results at face value and underscore the importance of interpreting such results in light of the most frequent words contained in the dictionaries, which can drive the overall dictionary results in unexpected ways.

These findings also highlight the value of triangulating language analyses across different levels of analysis (words, topics, and dictionaries) for arriving at more robust interpretations. Given that the typical Twitter user is younger (median age = 31 years; <ref type="bibr" coords="8,113.28,153.77,115.62,8.76" target="#b14">Fox, Zickurh, &amp; Smith, 2009</ref>) than the typical person at risk for AHD, it is not obvious why Twitter language should track heart-disease mortality. The people tweeting are not the people dying. However, the tweets of younger adults may disclose characteristics of their community, reflecting a shared economic, physical, and psychological environment. At the individual level, psychological variables and heart-disease risk are connected through multiple pathways, including health behaviors, social relationships, situation selection, and physiological reactivity <ref type="bibr" coords="8,88.88,273.77,102.82,8.76" target="#b16">(Friedman &amp; Kern, 2014)</ref>. These pathways occur within a broader social context that directly and indirectly influences an individual's life experiences. Local communities create physical and social environments that influence the behaviors, stress experiences, and health of their residents <ref type="bibr" coords="8,90.89,333.77,116.11,8.76" target="#b11">(Diez Roux &amp; Mair, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,212.29,333.77,80.39,8.76;8,48.00,345.77,107.22,8.76" target="#b24">Lochner, Kawachi, Brennan, &amp; Buka, 2003)</ref>. Epidemiological studies have found that the aggregated characteristics of communities, such as social cohesion and social capital, account for a significant portion of variation in health outcomes, independently of individual-level characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="8,253.55,393.77,39.15,8.76;8,48.00,405.77,22.40,8.76" target="#b22">(Leyland, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,74.03,405.77,129.55,8.76" target="#b33">Riva, Gauvin, &amp; Barnett, 2007)</ref>, such that the combined psychological character of the community is more informative for predicting risk than are the self-reports of any one individual. The language of Twitter may be a window into the aggregated and powerful effects of the community context.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Tweets constitute a biased sample in two ways. First, they may reflect socialdesirability biases, because people manage their online identities <ref type="bibr" coords="8,93.50,513.77,194.88,8.76" target="#b36">(Rost, Barkhuus, Cramer, &amp; Brown, 2013)</ref>. Second, Twitter users are not representative of the general population. The Twitter population tends to be more urban and to have higher levels of education <ref type="bibr" coords="8,254.00,549.77,38.72,8.76;8,48.00,561.77,187.43,8.76" target="#b26">(Mislove, Lehmann, Ahn, Onnela, &amp; Rosenquist, 2011)</ref>. In 2009, the median age of Twitter users <ref type="bibr" coords="8,177.80,573.77,71.93,8.76" target="#b14">(Fox et al., 2009</ref>) was 5.8 years below the U.S. median age (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). Nonetheless, our Twitter-based prediction model outperformed models based on classical risk factors in predicting AHD mortality; this suggests that, despite the biases, Twitter language captures as much unbiased AHD-relevant information about the general population as do traditional, representatively assessed predictors.</p><p>Another limitation is that our findings are crosssectional; future research should address the stability of psychological characteristics of counties across time. Also, we relied on AHD mortality rates reported by the CDC, which draws on the underlying cause of death recorded on death certificates; however, the coding on death certificates may be inconsistent <ref type="bibr" coords="8,473.95,93.77,81.24,8.76;8,310.50,105.77,21.83,8.76" target="#b31">(Pierce &amp; Denison, 2010)</ref>. Finally, associations between language and mortality do not point to causality; analyses of language on social media may complement other epidemiological methods, but the limits of causal inferences from observational studies have been repeatedly noted (e.g., Diez <ref type="bibr" coords="8,310.50,165.77,81.33,8.76" target="#b11">Roux &amp; Mair, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Traditional approaches for collecting psychosocial data from large representative samples, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System of the CDC and Gallup polls, tend to be expensive, are based on only thousands of people, and are often limited to a minimal, predefined list of psychological constructs. A Twitter-based system to track psychosocial variables is relatively inexpensive and can potentially generate estimates based on 10s of millions of people with much higher resolution in time and space. It is comparatively easy to create dictionaries automatically for different psychological or social constructs so that novel hypotheses can be tested. Our approach opens the door to a new generation of psychological informational epidemiology <ref type="bibr" coords="8,433.85,333.77,77.95,8.76" target="#b12">(Eysenbach, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="8,516.05,333.77,39.15,8.76;8,310.50,345.77,23.40,8.76" target="#b20">Labarthe, 2010)</ref> and could bring researchers closer to understanding the community-level psychological factors that are important for the cardiovascular health of communities and should become the focus of intervention.</p></div>

Analyses using the available heart disease, demographic, and socioeconomic information for the excluded counties revealed that, compared with the counties in the final sample, the excluded counties had smaller populations (median county population of 12,932 in 1,796 excluded counties vs. 78,265 in included counties), higher rates of AHD (Hedges's g = 0.48, 95% confidence interval, or CI = [0.38, 0.57]; n = 597 excluded counties with data available), lower income (g = −0.42, 95% CI = [−0.53, −0.32]; n = 496), and lower levels of education (g = −0.61, 95% CI = [−.72, −.51]; n = 496). The included and excluded counties did not differ in median age (g = 0.003, 95% CI = [−0.08, 0.08]; n = 1,004). 2. The anxiety and positive-relationships dictionaries were rated as having the lowest accuracies (55.0% and 55.5% respectively; see <ref type="table" coords="9,64.48,375.65,33.76,7.88">Table S2</ref> in the Supplemental Tables), whereas the accuracy of the other dictionaries was markedly higher (average accuracy = 82.1%). Cross-correlations of dictionaries (see <ref type="table" coords="9,271.46,397.64,21.02,7.88;9,48.00,408.64,8.82,7.88">Table  S3</ref> in the Supplemental Tables) revealed that the frequency of use of the positive-relationships and anxiety dictionaries were unexpectedly positively correlated with the frequencies of use of all other dictionaries. 3. The word love was removed from the dictionary because it accounted for more than a third of the occurrences of words from this dictionary, and including it distorted the results (see Discussion, and note 6). 4. For ease of interpretation, we have grouped these topics into seemingly related sets and added labels to summarize our sense of the topics. These labels are open to interpretation, and we present for inspection the most prevalent words within the topics. County-level topic-and dictionary-frequency data can be downloaded from https://osf.io/rt6w2/files/. 5. To compare our findings with published effect sizes, we converted correlation coefficients to relative risk values following the method of <ref type="bibr" coords="9,105.96,584.61,118.66,7.88" target="#b35">Rosenthal and DiMatteo (2001)</ref>. 6. In addition to having this word-sense ambiguity, mentions of love may signify a different kind of Twitter use in lower-SES areas. A factor analysis of the words in the positive-relationships dictionary revealed two factors with opposing correlations with SES. A general social factor (friends, agree, loved) correlated with higher SES (r = .14), and a partnership factor (relationship, boyfriend, girlfriend) correlated with lower SES (r = −.43), as well as higher AHD mortality (r = .18). Usage of the word love loaded much higher on this second factor than on the first one (see <ref type="table" coords="9,100.56,694.59,32.22,7.88">Table S5</ref> in the Supplemental Tables). This finding may be an indication that in lower-SES areas, users share more about personal relationships on Twitter, which distorts the results obtained when using the original positive-relationships dictionary.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,401.06,561.77,153.93,8.76;4,310.50,573.77,244.71,8.76;4,310.50,585.77,244.53,8.76;4,310.50,597.77,244.47,8.76;4,310.50,609.77,244.48,8.76;4,310.50,621.77,244.50,8.76;4,310.50,633.77,244.71,8.76;4,310.50,645.77,108.09,8.76"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>traditional factors: r = .42, 95% CI = [.38, .46]; 10 traditional factors only: r = .36, 95% CI = [.29, .43]), t(1346) = −2.22, p = .026.
