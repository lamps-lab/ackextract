<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Job satisfaction research has unfolded as an exemplary manifestation of the "person versus environment" debate in applied psychology. With the increasing recognition of the importance of time, it is informative to examine a question critical to the dispositional view of job satisfaction: Are genetic influences on job satisfaction stable across different time points? Drawing upon dispositional and situational perspectives on job satisfaction and recent research in developmental behavioral genetics, we examined whether the relative potency of genetic (i.e., the person) and environmental influences on job satisfaction changed over time in a 3-wave longitudinal twin study. Biometric behavioral genetics analyses showed that genetic influences accounted for 31.2% of the variance in job satisfaction measured at approximately Age 21, which was markedly greater than the 18.7% and 19.8% of variance explained by genetic factors at Age 25 and Age 30. Such genetic influences were mediated via positive affectivity and negative affectivity, but not via general mental ability. After partialing out genetic influences, environmental influences on job satisfaction were related to interpersonal conflict at work and occupational status, and these influences were relatively stable across the 3 time points. These results offer important implications for organizations and employees to better understand and implement practices to enhance job satisfaction.</p></div>

The assumption has been particularly evident in research inferring dispositional influences through the demonstration of the stability of job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" coords="2,115.90,187.04,76.65,7.91" target="#b159">(Staw &amp; Ross, 1985)</ref> and genetic influences on job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" coords="2,105.33,198.04,69.60,7.91" target="#b1">(Arvey et al., 1989)</ref>. In fact, this assumption is not unique to job satisfaction research. In a review of the job performance literature, <ref type="bibr" coords="2,111.75,220.04,57.26,7.91" target="#b161">Sturman (2007)</ref> found that most research on job performance had examined "the correlates of various sorts of job performance ratings, with the often implicit assumption that the results would generalize to the same population of subjects at any other point in time" (p. 50). Nevertheless, this crucial assumption, to our knowledge, has yet to be rigorously tested for job satisfaction.</p><p>Investigating whether influences from the person (e.g., through genetic influences) on job satisfaction are constant over time has important theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, explicitly incorporating a temporal perspective into the dispositional approach to job satisfaction "can change the ontological description and meaning" of dispositional influences <ref type="bibr" coords="2,222.10,352.04,65.93,7.91;2,48.00,363.04,48.21,7.91">(George &amp; Jones, 2000, p. 675)</ref> and therefore contributes to better theory building in job satisfaction research <ref type="bibr" coords="2,142.85,374.04,96.48,7.91" target="#b118">(Mitchell &amp; James, 2001)</ref>. Practically, findings of significant dispositional influences on job satisfaction have often been incorrectly interpreted as indicating, as <ref type="bibr" coords="2,254.24,396.04,33.81,7.91;2,48.00,407.04,83.53,7.91" target="#b158">Staw and Cohen-Charash (2005)</ref> lamented, that "there was little organizations could do to improve the lot of workers" (p. 66). In this regard, examining whether and how genetic influences on job satisfaction may change over time can, at least partly, mitigate such misinterpretations, and thus contribute to forming a healthy public image of applied psychology.</p><p>The purpose of the current study is threefold. First, using a three-wave longitudinal twin design, we investigate whether genetic influences-reflecting influences from the person-on job satisfaction are constant over time in early adulthood. In doing so, this study contributes to the job satisfaction literature by enriching the dispositional approach to job satisfaction from a temporal perspective. We note that there is an important advantage of utilizing genetic influences to reflect effects of the "whole" person (vs. the environment). A large number of individual difference variables may affect job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" coords="2,48.00,583.03,72.23,7.91" target="#b66">Ilies &amp; Judge, 2003)</ref>. It is thus impractical to examine their effects all at once in a single study to capture person-related effects collectively. The longitudinal twin design, however, enables us to examine the aggregate contribution of these individual difference variables as reflected in the (potentially time-varying) estimates of overall genetic influences <ref type="bibr" coords="2,148.15,638.03,139.91,7.91;2,48.00,649.03,60.55,7.91" target="#b71">(Johnson, Turkheimer, Gottesman, &amp; Bouchard, 2009)</ref>, because virtually all individual characteristics are genetically influenced <ref type="bibr" coords="2,145.46,660.03,63.73,7.91" target="#b12">(Bouchard, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,212.18,660.03,67.10,7.91" target="#b169">Turkheimer, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>Second, we discern the roles of general mental ability, positive affectivity (PA), and negative affectivity (NA) in mediating genetic influences on job satisfaction over time. These three individual characteristics have been most widely suggested or examined in previous job satisfaction research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,204.97,715.03,83.07,7.91;2,306.01,77.03,61.89,7.91" target="#b31">Cropanzano, James, &amp; Konovsky, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,370.03,77.03,72.66,7.91" target="#b66">Ilies &amp; Judge, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,444.84,77.03,62.41,7.91" target="#b157">Staw et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,509.39,77.03,36.64,7.91;2,306.01,88.03,46.32,7.91" target="#b176">Watson &amp; Slack, 1993)</ref> as well as in research on how genetic factors affect work-related outcomes through individual characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="2,377.58,110.03,59.20,7.91" target="#b64">Ilies et al., 2006)</ref>. The current study thus sheds light on the pathways through which genetic influences affect job satisfaction over time and the relative explanatory power of the three individual characteristics in the mediating processes. As such, this study serves as a critical first step to advance our understanding of the biological foundations of job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" coords="2,306.00,176.03,145.48,7.91" target="#b6">(Becker, Cropanzano, &amp; Sanfey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,455.05,176.03,64.19,7.91" target="#b64">Ilies et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,522.80,176.03,23.25,7.91;2,306.00,187.03,97.48,7.91" target="#b82">Judge, Piccolo, &amp; Kosalka, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,406.47,187.03,104.59,7.91" target="#b147">Senior, Lee, &amp; Butler, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Third, drawing upon the literature on the situational approach to job satisfaction, we investigate whether influences from two critical work environmental factors-occupational status and interpersonal conflict at work-contribute to job satisfaction over time while partialing out the aggregated, genetically involved influences that are attributable to the person <ref type="bibr" coords="2,461.01,253.03,81.16,7.91" target="#b71">(Johnson et al., 2009)</ref>. Such an investigation not only complements the inquiries into genetic influences on job satisfaction over time but also addresses one important limitation of classical behavioral genetics research: a failure to examine specific genetic and/or environmental factors. The two work environment variables have been suggested and extensively examined in the literatures on omnibus and discrete work contexts <ref type="bibr" coords="2,361.90,330.03,50.44,7.91" target="#b68">(Johns, 2006)</ref> as well as on environmental influences on job satisfaction (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="2,422.86,341.03,123.19,7.91;2,306.00,352.03,20.50,7.91" target="#b65">Ilies, Johnson, Judge, &amp; Keeney, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,328.70,352.04,128.81,7.91" target="#b77">Judge &amp; Kammeyer-Mueller, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,459.71,352.04,47.44,7.91" target="#b99">Locke, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,509.34,352.04,36.69,7.91;2,306.00,363.04,37.94,7.91" target="#b155">Spector &amp; Jex, 1998)</ref>. It is vitally important to control for effects of the person (i.e., through genetic influences) when examining environmental influences on job satisfaction, because many presumed "environmental variables" are confounded by influences from the person through self and/or organizational selection <ref type="bibr" coords="2,490.85,407.04,55.21,7.91;2,306.00,418.04,98.05,7.91" target="#b5">(Arvey, Zhang, Avolio, &amp; Krueger, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,407.91,418.04,94.41,7.91" target="#b76">Judge, Ilies, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="2,506.17,418.04,39.85,7.91;2,306.00,429.04,45.10,7.91" target="#b87">Kendler &amp; Baker, 2007)</ref>. In fact, most research on situational influences of job satisfaction has not been able to partial out effects from the person, resulting in potential overestimates of situational effects <ref type="bibr" coords="2,519.83,451.04,26.24,7.91;2,306.00,462.04,61.15,7.91" target="#b76">(Judge, Ilies, et al., 2012)</ref>. Therefore, by controlling for genetic influences, this study represents a more stringent test of the situational perspective on job satisfaction over time. <ref type="figure" coords="2,451.82,484.04,31.43,7.91" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> depicts the conceptual model of this study adapted from <ref type="bibr" coords="2,460.94,495.04,80.97,7.91" target="#b66">Ilies and Judge (2003)</ref>.</p><p>proach represents a major strength, but it is also limited for not being able to pinpoint specific genetic or environmental factors. To partially address this limitation, we incorporate specific genetic factors related to general mental ability, PA, and NA, as well as work environments related to occupational status and interpersonal conflict at work. These investigations provide a more nuanced picture of job satisfaction's antecedents.</p><p>Previous dispositional research has implicitly or explicitly portrayed genetic influences on job satisfaction as relatively stable. Researchers have used two reasons to explain rank-order stability in job satisfaction: (a) the genetic variants influencing individual differences seldom change over time, and (b) the magnitude of genetic influences on job satisfaction are relatively stable <ref type="bibr" coords="3,127.30,440.04,160.73,7.91" target="#b16">Bouchard, Arvey, Keller, &amp; Segal, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,48.00,451.04,89.74,7.91" target="#b34">Dormann &amp; Zapf, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,140.75,451.04,52.24,7.91" target="#b42">George, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,195.99,451.04,73.14,7.91" target="#b159">Staw &amp; Ross, 1985)</ref>. Put differently, if influences from genetic factors or genetically affected dispositional variables change substantially over time, then we would not have observed between-person rank-order stability in job satisfaction longitudinally. Multiple single-time-point, cross-sectional twin studies, which suggest that the magnitude of genetic influence does not vary with age, seem to indirectly support stable genetic influences on job satisfaction. In their seminal article, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,75.05,539.04,68.67,7.91" target="#b1">Arvey et al. (1989)</ref> reported that approximately 30% of the variance in general job satisfaction was attributable to genetic differences. A follow-up study using a larger sample confirmed this finding <ref type="bibr" coords="3,92.95,572.04,195.09,7.91;3,48.00,583.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b3">(Arvey, McCall, Bouchard, Taubman, &amp; Cavanaugh, 1994)</ref>. This notion and related research findings have also become the foundation for subsequent meta-analyses examining mediating mechanisms in the relationship between genetic factors and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" coords="3,92.98,616.04,80.06,7.91" target="#b66">(Ilies &amp; Judge, 2003)</ref>.  even predicted that "twin studies of job satisfaction using adult samples in the age range 25 to 50 years will yield a heritability of about 0.30" (p. 92). However, to date, there have been no longitudinal examinations of whether genetic influences on job satisfaction are constant over time, especially during early adulthood when changes in one's work environment are prevalent <ref type="bibr" coords="3,250.79,682.04,37.24,7.91;3,48.00,693.04,19.37,7.91" target="#b136">(Rindfuss, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>With regard to the direction of the potential change (i.e., increase or decrease) of genetic influence on job satisfaction over time, the person-environment fit literature and the situational perspective on job satisfaction offer two contrasting predictions. On the one hand, person-environment fit research posits that individual characteristics (e.g., abilities and personality traits) become increasingly important in shaping job satisfaction, because as individuals age, they select themselves into life experiences that are more compatible with their characteristics <ref type="bibr" coords="3,484.63,364.88,61.43,7.91" target="#b37">(Edwards, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,306.00,376.17,108.39,7.91" target="#b89">Kristof-Brown &amp; Guay, 2010)</ref>. As such, job satisfaction over time would be more reflective of the person, indicating increasing genetic influences on job satisfaction over time.</p><p>Multiple research streams support this argument. First, the gravitational hypothesis and related research suggest that through multiple processes (e.g., occupational and organization selection, and job crafting), individuals gradually gravitate into work environments compatible with their abilities <ref type="bibr" coords="3,446.78,455.24,99.29,7.91;3,306.00,466.53,57.00,7.91" target="#b110">(McCormick, Jeanneret, &amp; Mecham, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,365.76,466.53,128.28,7.91" target="#b179">Wilk, Desmarais, &amp; Sackett, 1995)</ref> and personality traits <ref type="bibr" coords="3,341.72,477.83,73.18,7.91" target="#b72">(Judge et al., 1999)</ref>. By extension, via such selection processes, characteristics of the person become increasingly influential over the life span. Second, the ecology model of individuality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="3,344.76,511.71,95.02,7.91" target="#b121">Mumford &amp; Stokes, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,442.03,511.71,104.01,7.91;3,306.00,523.01,48.82,7.91" target="#b122">Mumford, Stokes, Owens, &amp; Stokes, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,356.88,523.01,126.49,7.91" target="#b160">Stokes, Mumford, &amp; Owens, 1989)</ref> indicates that the importance of individual characteristics in shaping work experiences may increase with age. Third, personality psychologists have also theorized and found that personality traits that lead people to compatible experiences are also likely to be further strengthened by such experiences (i.e., the corresponsive principle; <ref type="bibr" coords="3,502.84,579.49,38.70,7.91;3,306.00,590.79,75.40,7.91" target="#b25">Caspi, Roberts, &amp; Shiner, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,383.70,590.79,116.83,7.91" target="#b137">Roberts, Caspi, &amp; Moffitt, 2003)</ref>. Therefore, the enhanced correspondence over time between individual characteristics and life experiences would lead to an increased degree of influence from the person. Similarly, behavioral genetic research suggests that as people age, they have increasing control over selecting or creating experiences that foster the development of their genetically influenced dispositions. Because such self-selected or self-created experiences partially reflect genetic dispositions, the enhanced control over environments can amplify genetic influences over time <ref type="bibr" coords="3,504.22,692.45,41.84,7.91;3,306.00,703.74,21.22,7.91" target="#b11">(Bouchard, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,330.88,703.74,173.94,7.91" target="#b112">McGue, Bouchard, Iacono, &amp; Lykken, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,508.47,703.74,37.56,7.91;3,306.00,715.04,55.57,7.91" target="#b134">Plomin &amp; Spinath, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,364.93,715.04,97.21,7.91" target="#b143">Scarr &amp; McCartney, 1983</ref>  This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>On the other hand, the situational perspective on job satisfaction suggests decreasing genetic influences on job satisfaction over time. As they age, individuals are gradually exposed to more and more work experiences that are exogenously introduced by organizations <ref type="bibr" coords="4,84.01,121.04,60.13,7.91" target="#b136">(Rindfuss, 1991)</ref>. Given that individuals' work experiences are not solely influenced by their individual characteristics, over time, the work experiences may be increasingly reflective of environmental influences. Indeed, considering the importance of organizational contexts, <ref type="bibr" coords="4,139.88,165.04,46.07,7.91" target="#b156">Staw (2004)</ref> stated, "It is possible that genetic effects become so diluted by strong work situations that they ultimately have little influence on job satisfaction" (p. 169). We therefore expect that such a diluting effect may be more pronounced in early adulthood because of the dramatic changes in one's work-related experiences (e.g., from being a newcomer to an experienced employee, switching employers, getting promoted and taking more responsibilities at work, starting to balance work and family demands; <ref type="bibr" coords="4,111.77,253.04,56.51,7.91" target="#b136">Rindfuss, 1991)</ref>.

We performed three sets of biometric analyses: univariate, bivariate, and trivariate, all based on multigroup (i.e., monozygotic <ref type="bibr" coords="7,432.16,373.27,19.49,7.91">[MZ]</ref> and dizygotic [DZ] twin groups) structural equation modeling <ref type="bibr" coords="7,451.53,384.27,94.51,7.91" target="#b123">(Neale &amp; Cardon, 1992;</ref>. Univariate biometric analyses were used to examine the stability and change of genetic influences on job satisfaction across the three measurement times (Hypotheses 1a and 1b). In univariate biometric analyses, an observed variable, P, is modeled to be influenced by three latent factors-A (additive genetic factors), C (shared environmental factors that cause similarity among family members), and E (unique environmental influences that make individuals different such as unique family and occupational experiences and potential measurement error):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0" coords="7,372.82,500.62,173.21,9.00">P ϭ u ϩ a ‫ء‬ A ϩ c ‫ء‬ C ϩ e ‫ء‬ E<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P represents an observed variable; A, C, and E are standardized latent genetic and environmental variables (with means and variances specified at 0 and 1, respectively); a, c, and e are their corresponding coefficients to be estimated; and u denotes the intercept or mean phenotypic score.

Genetic influences on P can be estimated as a 2 / (a 2 ϩc 2 ϩe 2 ). Although it seems that such biometric analyses are similar to simple regression analyses in terms of variance decomposition, using multigroup structural equation modeling has three advantages. First, it readily offers estimates of confidence intervals (CIs), which can be used to assess the stability and change of genetic influences on job satisfaction over time. Second, it allows researchers to parametrize the corresponding cross-twin correlations (e.g., Twin 1 and Twin 2 of the same twin pair) of latent genetic and environmental factors to differ-This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly. ent values for the MZ and DZ twin groups.

As shown in <ref type="figure" coords="8,130.91,99.13,30.28,7.91" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, for the MZ (DZ) twin group, the correlation between two genetic factors, A 1 and A 2 , was set to 1.0 (0.5) because co-twins, on average, share 100% (50%) of their genetic makeup. The correlation between two shared environmental factors, C 1 and C 2 , was set to 1.0, by definition, for both twin groups. The correlation between two unshared environmental factors, E 1 and E 2 , was set to zero for both groups.

Similarly, the percentage of the total variance in job satisfaction accounted for by environmental factors related to an environmental predictor is e 21 2 /(a 21 2 ϩ a 22 2 ϩ e 21 2 ϩ e 22 2 ), which was used to test Research Questions 2 and 3.

The product-of-coefficients approach uses a m ϫ b m to quantify the mediation effect, where a m is the path from the predictor to the mediator, and b m is the path from the mediator to the outcome while controlling for the predictor (with path c m = ). The difference-in-coefficients approach uses c mc m = , where c m is the total effect of the predictor on the outcome and c m = is the predictor's residual effect after controlling for the mediator.

Because the total amount of variance in job satisfaction explained by genetic factors is the same in univariate as in bivariate models, the total effect of genetic influences (i.e., "c m ") on job satisfaction is captured by the path a in a univariate model (see <ref type="figure" coords="9,64.56,517.04,28.82,7.91" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>), which is equivalent to the square root of (a 21 2 ϩ a 22 2 ), where a 21 and a 22 are path coefficients in a bivariate model (see <ref type="figure" coords="9,48.00,539.04,29.62,7.91">Figure 3</ref>). After an individual difference variable is introduced to the model, the a 22 path represents the residual genetic effect "c m = ." Therefore, translating the c mc m = formula into a bivariate biometric model, our second approach used [sqrt(a 21 2 ϩ a 22 2 )a 22 ] to quantify a mediation effect.</p><p>Trivariate biometric analyses. Lastly, trivariate biometric analyses were conducted to corroborate the results of univariate analyses, examining the change of genetic influences on job satisfaction by simultaneously including all the three job satisfaction measures in one model (see <ref type="figure" coords="9,191.38,638.04,35.10,7.91" target="#fig_3">Figure 4)</ref>.

To address Research Question 1, we compared the magnitudes of the mediating effects of the three individual difference variables in the relationship between genetic factors and job satisfaction over time.

Researchers have devoted a great deal of attention to examining the antecedents of job satisfaction, primarily from two contrasting perspectives-the dispositional and situational approaches. Mirroring this line of inquiry, behavioral genetics research has contributed greatly to the natureversus-nurture debate, which is a variation of the person-versusenvironment debate. As a result, twin studies have been increasingly adopted in applied psychology research to study how the person plays an indispensable role in shaping work experiences as reflected by their genetic influences, and more interestingly, the causal effects of environmental influences after genetic influences are partialed out (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,48.00,660.04,66.03,7.91" target="#b1">Arvey et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,116.58,660.04,59.03,7.91" target="#b64">Ilies et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,178.16,660.04,86.02,7.91" target="#b76">Judge, Ilies, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,266.74,660.04,21.29,7.91;14,48.00,671.04,40.71,7.91" target="#b148">Shane et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>With the emerging trend of developmental behavioral genetic research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="14,105.05,693.04,112.48,7.91" target="#b23">Briley &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,221.95,693.04,66.08,7.91;14,48.00,704.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b130">Plomin &amp; Deary, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="14,71.79,704.04,89.23,7.91" target="#b170">Turkheimer et al., 2014)</ref>, applied psychology research has lagged behind by not incorporating the role of time in examining genetic influences on job satisfaction.

On the contrary, genetic factors associated with PA and NA measured at Age 25 seemed to be more important in transmitting the overall genetic influences on job satisfaction. The differential mediation roles of general mental ability, PA, and NA might be related to the fact that they were assessed at distinct measurement time points. However, genetic influences mediated by the three individual characteristics did not change substantially over time while the overall genetic influences on job satisfaction decreased with age. The results suggest that other individual differences may play a mediating role in accounting for the decrease in genetic influences on job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" coords="15,192.04,473.04,96.01,7.91;15,48.00,484.04,20.50,7.91" target="#b81">(Judge, Locke, &amp; Durham, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="15,71.50,484.04,86.34,7.91" target="#b109">McCartney et al., 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Environmental influences on job satisfaction over time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p>Findings from behavioral genetics research are often misinterpreted, and we caution against any simplistic interpretation of our findings. Results of the current research may have implications for both organizations and employees. First, the change of genetic influences on job satisfaction over time provided an explicit demonstration that we should not simply interpret genetics-related findings as indicating that because a variable is highly genetically influenced, it is not malleable <ref type="bibr" coords="16,85.26,308.04,53.64,7.91" target="#b45">(Gerhart, 2005)</ref>. Our results suggest that genetic factors explained less individual differences in job satisfaction at Age 25 and Age 30 compared with Age 21. Put differently, the person seems to play a less important role in shaping job satisfaction as employees age. This finding also suggests that during early adulthood, employees' job satisfaction levels may be more shaped by environmental factors such as organizational practices, and that these external factors may become increasingly important over time. In other words, employees appeared to become gradually more adaptive during this period of time. Organizations may therefore have more room to influence employees' job satisfaction as employees progress through early adulthood.</p><p>Do the diminishing influences of genetic factors on job satisfaction mean that organizations can disregard individual differences over time? The literature on person-environment fit <ref type="bibr" coords="16,48.00,473.04,63.43,7.91" target="#b37">(Edwards, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,115.47,473.04,118.44,7.91" target="#b89">Kristof-Brown &amp; Guay, 2010)</ref> suggests not. The current results do not suggest so either. Instead, our findings show that genetic influences on job satisfaction remained significant over time. Researchers have called for more individualized or personalized management practices that capitalize on person-environment correlations <ref type="bibr" coords="16,189.57,528.04,98.47,7.91" target="#b76">(Judge, Ilies, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,48.00,539.04,53.95,7.91" target="#b90">Lawler, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,105.86,539.04,62.21,7.91" target="#b139">Rousseau, 2005)</ref>. Along this line, our findings suggest that organizations need to consistently consider employees' individual characteristics when they strive to enhance employee job satisfaction over time during early adulthood. Our findings also suggest that PA was more important in mediating genetic influences on job satisfaction over time than general mental ability during early adulthood. In other words, PA played a more important role in reflecting the influences of the person. Thus, it seems that when organizations consider adopting individualized practices, they should pay more attention to the importance of personality (e.g., PA) in customizing their practices, rather than to general mental ability.</p><p>The finding that interpersonal conflict consistently explained an important amount of the variance in job satisfaction suggests that organizations and employees should endeavor to eliminate negative interactions and improve positive relationships in organizations as a means of improving employees' job satisfac-tion. Given that effects of work design practices oftentimes do not endure across time <ref type="bibr" coords="16,396.83,88.03,55.20,7.91" target="#b47">(Griffin, 1981)</ref>, our finding has particular implications for organizations to enhance employee job satisfaction from a longer period of time. That is, maintaining lower levels of interpersonal conflict appears to be a useful approach for fostering enduring, high levels of job satisfaction across time. Among individual-differences variables, PA seems most important in shaping job satisfaction over time. Previous research drawing this conclusion often suggested utilizing personnel selection methods to hire individuals with elevated trait levels of PA. This seems to be a reasonable recommendation for organizations. On the other hand, recent personality research has shown that levels of personality traits may change over time <ref type="bibr" coords="16,306.00,220.03,144.51,7.91" target="#b83">(Judge, Simon, Hurst, &amp; Kelley, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,452.88,220.03,93.17,7.91;16,306.00,231.03,42.50,7.91" target="#b94">Li, Fay, Frese, Harms, &amp; Gao, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,352.00,231.03,79.00,7.91" target="#b137">Roberts et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,434.50,231.03,79.29,7.91" target="#b182">Wu &amp; Griffin, 2012)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Strengths, Limitations, and Future Research</head><p>The most important strength of our study was that we used a three-wave longitudinal twin study design with data collected from multiple sources (e.g., self-report, proctored assessment, interview, and expert coding). Capitalizing on a longitudinal, natural quasiexperiment of two types of twins <ref type="bibr" coords="16,429.34,363.04,75.42,7.91" target="#b132">(Plomin et al., 1994)</ref> enabled us to address critical research questions about genetic and environmental influences on job satisfaction over time, which have not been addressed previously.</p><p>Still, this study was limited in several ways. First, using the longitudinal twin database allowed us to examine only a limited number of important predictors of job satisfaction. Although we studied important individual difference variables (e.g., general mental ability, PA, and NA) as well as omnibus and specific work contextual variables, as suggested by previous research, future research should examine other individual characteristics (e.g., core self-evaluations <ref type="bibr" coords="16,408.58,484.04,72.54,7.91" target="#b81">[Judge et al., 1997]</ref> and the Big Five factors and facets) as well as additional work characteristics (e.g., job autonomy; <ref type="bibr" coords="16,386.92,506.04,88.06,7.91" target="#b61">Humphrey et al., 2007)</ref>. Second, we only studied overall job satisfaction in this study. Future research could examine other job satisfaction variables (e.g., intrinsic job satisfaction, satisfaction with pay). Third, in this study, PA and NA were measured before the first job satisfaction variable was assessed, and we examined them as antecedents of job satisfaction. Although personality traits, especially their rankorder stability, are unlikely to change dramatically over time <ref type="bibr" coords="16,306.00,594.04,70.96,7.91" target="#b25">(Caspi et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,379.34,594.04,76.45,7.91" target="#b111">McCrae et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,458.18,594.04,87.86,7.91;16,306.00,605.04,20.12,7.91" target="#b138">Roberts &amp; DelVecchio, 2000)</ref>, we cannot rule out the possibility of reciprocal relationships between individual characteristics and job satisfaction <ref type="bibr" coords="16,534.72,616.04,11.34,7.91;16,306.00,627.04,48.06,7.91" target="#b94">(Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,358.38,627.04,97.56,7.91" target="#b146">Scollon &amp; Diener, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,460.26,627.04,81.74,7.91" target="#b182">Wu &amp; Griffin, 2012)</ref>. Fourth, as with any other research methodology, although the twin methodology has its strengths in estimating the relative potency of genetic and environmental influences on observed variables, and has been embraced by many disciplines (e.g., <ref type="bibr" coords="16,306.00,682.04,113.19,7.91" target="#b23">Briley &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,422.65,682.04,118.66,7.91;16,306.00,693.04,84.01,7.91" target="#b26">Cesarini, Johannesson, Magnusson, &amp; Wallace, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,392.51,693.04,100.47,7.91" target="#b38">Fowler &amp; Schreiber, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,495.49,693.04,50.54,7.91" target="#b39">Freese, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,306.00,704.04,62.72,7.91" target="#b64">Ilies et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="16,371.07,704.04,131.31,7.91" target="#b117">P.

For example, the equal environments assumption in This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.</p><p>This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.</p><p>twin studies assumes that the similarity caused by environmental factors (including both family and societal influences) is generally the same for both identical and fraternal twins.

In addition, prenatal and neonatal differences may somewhat affect estimates of genetic influences, because identical twins share the same chorion and thus may experience different environmental differences than fraternal twins before they are born. However, such differences would lead to the genetic influences identified in twin studies to be underestimates . Estimates of unique environmental influences (E factors) often include measurement error. In addition, it is possible that nonsignificant, shared environmental effects observed in this study were caused by range restriction (i.e., there was not sufficient variance in the family environments of participants). 2 Acknowledging those limitations, <ref type="bibr" coords="17,93.54,264.04,145.26,7.91" target="#b188">Zyphur, Zhang, Barsky, and Li (2013)</ref> nevertheless concluded that "if researchers are interested in understanding a broad sense of genetic influences on observed variables, traditional twin models are adequate" (p. 572).

Future research should examine whether the same findings hold for employees in other life stages and in other economic situations. Sixth, although we outlined two mechanisms through which PA and NA may affect job satisfaction, we were unable to distinguish them empirically.

Eighth, as pointed by one of our anonymous reviewers, we were unable to study potential changes of the genetic influences on the three individual difference variables at the three time points when job satisfaction was measured. This prevented us from examining whether the changes in genetic influences on job satisfaction over time were related to possible changes in the genetic and environmental influences on the three individual difference variables at the same time points. This is an important direction for future research. Lastly, we did not study specific genes related to job satisfaction over time, as done in previous research <ref type="bibr" coords="17,254.52,572.04,33.53,7.91;17,48.00,583.04,97.23,7.91">(Chi, Li, Wang, &amp; Song, in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="17,149.03,583.04,59.03,7.91" target="#b95">Li et al., 2015;</ref>.
