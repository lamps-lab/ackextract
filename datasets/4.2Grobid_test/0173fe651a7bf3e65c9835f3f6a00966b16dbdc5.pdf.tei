<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a global disease that, despite extensive research, has limited treatment options. Pet dogs share both an environment and lifestyle attributes with their owners, and a growing awareness is developing in the public and among researchers that One Medicine, the mutual co-study of animals and humans, could be beneficial for both humans and dogs. To that end, this Review highlights research opportunities afforded by studying dogs with spontaneous OA, with a view to sharing this active area of veterinary research with new audiences. Similarities and differences between dog and human OA are examined, and the proposition is made that suitably aligned studies of spontaneous OA in dogs and humans, in particular hip and knee OA, could highlight new avenues of discovery. Developing cross-species collaborations will provide a wealth of research material and knowledge that is relevant to human OA and that cannot currently be obtained from rodent models or experimentally induced dog models of OA.</p><p>Ultimately, this Review aims to raise awareness of spontaneous dog OA and to stimulate discussion regarding its exploration under the One Medicine initiative to improve the health and well-being of both species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[H1] Introduction</head><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the end point of synovial joint disease processes that interrupt the articular surface or cause instability and mechanical injury. In 2005, 26.9 million adults in the USA were estimated to have OA 1 , and according to a 2016 white paper from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI), globally, OA accounted for 2.4% of all years lived with disability 2 . The importance of OA as a global disease and a modern major health challenge therefore necessitates new research strategies.</p><p>Experimentally-induced models of OA are available in many large and small animal species . This work heralded the introduction of surgically-induced OA models in small, geneticallytractable species such as mice and rats Undeniably, because they are small, easy to house and relatively inexpensive, such rodent models have contributed to important advances in our understanding of basic disease mechanisms 3 . However, rodent models have proved to be poor predictors of the efficacy or toxicity of drugs in trials for human OA</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7</head><p>. Rodent models of OA are usually either chemically-induced or surgicallyinduced; however, the veracity of the joint changes that occur following administration of intra-articular papain or monosodium iodoacetate has been questioned, and many researchers have concluded that chemically-induced OA should be limited to studies of joint pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Hence, surgical joint destabilization is the most frequently employed model. Although the value of these rapidly changing rodent OA models should not be underestimated, naturally occurring disease in companion animals more closely reflects the complex genetic, physiological and environmental variation that occur in human OA 9,10 .</p><p>Spontaneous, slow-progressing OA occurs in multiple strains of mice, as well as in guinea pigs, Syrian hamsters, non-human primates and dogs</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11</head><p>; the histopathology and pathogenesis of dog OA most closely resemble those of primary human OA. Similar to humans, OA is also a common disease in the dog, with a prevalence that varies from 2.5% overall in UK veterinary primary care practices 12 to over 20% in dogs over 1 year old in the USA</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>13</head><p>. The clinically affected dog shares complex naturally occurring traits and comorbidities, such as obesity, that occur in humans, and both humans and companion dogs live into old age, share environments and activities and often receive almost identical treatments, such as long-term administration of anti-inflammatory drugs or joint replacement surgery. Academic and private practice veterinary medicine can provide valuable biomedical research data, as referral centres are often equipped with MRI and CT scanners, arthroscopes and state-of-the-art pathology and molecular diagnostic capabilities. Academic veterinary centres also pilot advances in the use of anti-inflammatory and pain-modulating OA drug therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> . In this Review, we summarize research relating to common forms of spontaneous dog OA, focusing on the presentation and genetics of analogous diseases of the hip and knee, within a framework of human OA phenotypes. We also aim to encourage researchers to take on the principles of One Medicine research to benefit both humans and dogs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The dog as a model animal</head><p>The foreshortened lifespan of the dog, with its equivalent life stages to humans, holds potential for the longitudinal evaluation of disease and therapy in spontaneous OA <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref> Overall, although dog OA is likely to be more variable and takes longer to develop than rodent models of OA, and also requires larger numbers of animals to achieve appropriately powered study design than rodent studies, the study of naturally occurring dog OA could lead to a reduction in the number of animals used for experimental research and to a greater understanding of spontaneous OA. In the following sections we outline some common forms of naturally occurring dog OA and review their suitability as models for analogous human disease <ref type="figure">(Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analogous dog and human OA disease</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hip dysplasia</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Presentation</head><p>Hip dysplasia is a common risk factor for both human and dog OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref> . . This SNP and SNPs at two more loci near TRIM2 and DPP4 were subsequently associated with CHD in a post hoc analysis of the same data   <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">99</ref> . Genetic associations with human ACL rupture found a COL1A1 SNP that was replicated in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">104</ref> . A systematic review 100 was followed by a GWAS that failed to reveal any ACL rupture-associated variants, highlighting the fact that replication and cross-species overlap will be mutually supportive in the investigation of complex traits.</p><p>Five-year-old dogs consistently have degenerative changes in their CCLs at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4b</ref>). Susceptibility to CCL rupture is increased in Labrador Retrievers and Golden</p><p>Retrievers, and the CCLs of these breeds have higher collagen turnover, less stiffness and less mature collagen crosslinks than the CCLs of Greyhounds, which are relatively rupture resistant</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>82</head><p>. . This lack of replication is probably caused by limitations similar to those for CHD. Functional studies that utilize relevant temporal tissue samples from dog OA at various stages to identify expression QTLs that overlap with genomic QTLs will be necessary to establish causation ( <ref type="figure">Figure   2</ref>).</p><p>Dog CCL rupture as a model for human ACL rupture.</p><p>Spontaneous CCL rupture might be analogous to experimental transection in dogs, as osteophytes and sclerosis develop at an early stage81 and end-stage OA develops over several years <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">110</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Figure 4d</ref>). However, the aetiology is likely to differ, as the dog CCL ruptures at its mid-substance during normal activity, and is often linked with prior degeneration and moderate to severe OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">87</ref> . Although CCL transection induces 8 synovitis, lymphocytic-plasmacytic synovitis also occurs in spontaneous CCL rupture <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">112</ref> . . A more complete understanding of the similarities and differences in OA related to dog CCL rupture and human ACL rupture might unveil the hormonal influences that underpin the markedly higher primary human knee OA incidence in post-menopausal females than in age-matched men</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>123</head><p>.</p><p>We are not arguing that human and dog cruciate ligament rupture have identical inciting causes, nor identical management strategies (Box 3), but instead aim to highlight that both involve mechanical instability and intractable progression to knee OA, thereby making simultaneous research in both species potentially beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other conditions of interest</head><p>Osteochondritis dessicans.</p><p>Dog shoulders develop both age-related primary OA 22 and osteochondrosis, which presents as osteochondritis dessicans lesions 124 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>) that are characterised by disordered endochondral ossification superimposed upon previously normal growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[125]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[126]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[127]</ref> . Osteochondrosis predominates in medium and large breeds of dogs, affects males more than females and is often bilateral and site-specific</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>128</head><p>. Intriguingly, male humans are also more frequently affected with osteochondrosis, and bilateral disease is also common <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">130</ref> .</p><p>Unilateral osteochondrosis in young dogs enables tissue samples to be collected of early contralateral lesions 9 and arthroscopic autologous or biomaterial articular resurfacing to be carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">132</ref> . Aberrant reinduction of endochondral ossification processes have been described in articular cartilage in several forms of human and mouse OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">134</ref> , and it is therefore intriguing that the dog shoulder is targeted in this particular way, much more so than in the human.</p><p>Control of endochondral ossification differs markedly in different breeds of dogs, which can have an astounding several-fold size variation and differ in growth rate and/or physeal closure at puberty. Earlier physeal closure in small breeds is consistent with more rapid growth, and potential predisposition to osteochondritis dessicans.</p><p>Growth plates in large breeds, such as Great Danes, have an expanded hypertrophic region and more active bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-BMP6 signalling than miniature breeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">135</ref> , suggesting that studies of osteochondritis dessicans could provide unique insights into the function of longitudinal bone growth in these disease processes. Another possible connection has emerged from studies that established direct links between genetic selection for high growth rates, failure of mechano-adaptive bone changes and predisposition to skeletal diseases in other species <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">126</ref> . Whether similar relationships persist in dogs and humans has yet to be explored.</p><p>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.</p><p>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD), a form of avascular necrosis of the femoral head, involves slow femoral head destruction in children. LCPD has a direct ortholog in small breed dogs <ref type="figure">(Figure 6</ref>), such as Yorkshire . Further genetic studies have been described in both dogs and humans, with intriguing differences and similarities <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[144]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[145]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[146]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[147]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[148]</ref> , discussion of which is beyond the scope of this Review.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A One Medicine approach</head><p>The idea that OA is not one disease, but a syndrome encompassing heterogeneous, stratified groups of patients with characteristic aetiologies has been gaining acceptance. This shift in thinking has led to an increased appreciation that the development of new targeted therapeutic approaches might be accelerated by patient stratification on the basis of phenotype (or endotype), which might also improve alignment with preclinical animal models. An initial attempt at disease stratification of patients with knee OA proposed five . We conjecture that the common dog OA types we have highlighted herein provide models for ready alignment with human OA on the basis of anatomy, aetiology and pathophysiology <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, and propose a system for their use with a view to analogous human OA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advantages of studying spontaneous clinical disease in dogs</head><p>Is there any prospect that the study of dog OA might accelerate new developments in human OA? Currently, cancer research is the field that has most readily adopted and successfully applied a One Medicine approach. . From the diseases highlighted in this Review, we outline five clear opportunities provided by adopting a similar One Medicine approach in OA research.</p><p>A source of tissue for research.</p><p>From the examples provided in the proposed OA sub-categorization <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref> . Similarly, resected osteoarthritic femoral heads and synovium from hip replacement procedures could be used to facilitate a greater understanding of OA mechanisms, and could perhaps be used to improve diagnostic and prognostic criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11</head><p>The correlation of arthroscopic, surgical and advanced imaging data with stage-specific changes in tissue samples taken from dogs with specific OA phenotypes would also be possible; for example, correlating A means to identify the genetic basis of analogous disease.</p><p>The study of purebred dogs lends itself to the genetic analysis of complex diseases such as hip dysplasia, osteochondritis dessicans and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Residual blood collected for routine haematology or biochemistry tests in the clinic could be used for many purposes, including as a source of DNA for genetic research; removed tissues could also be utilised for such studies. Making use of the broad linkage disequilibrium introduced by selective breeding in breeds with a high predilection for a disease compared with breeds with a low predilection for a disease will help to identify common candidate disease-associated genes in these polygenetic conditions.</p><p>A source of clinically applicable functional outcome measures.</p><p>One clear difference between dogs and humans is the ability to self-report pain. As subjective pain measures can be readily quantified in humans, objective data has been used sparingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">163</ref> . Instead, clinical metrology instruments and a patient-centred approach to outcome assessment has become a mainstay in the assessment of human OA. A patient-centered approach has also been incorporated into veterinary assessments; clinical metrology instruments and validated outcome questionnaires are used to capture painrelated behaviour over long periods of time in home environments 164 and pet owners can provide proxy assessments, just as parents or care-givers would for young children or adults with dementia <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[165]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[166]</ref> . Although objective assessment methods are less readily available than proxy reporting, these instruments have been , which has led to objective force plate outcome measurement becoming a common gold standard for functional assessment in dogs. Kinematic evaluation, as well as the more commonly used kinetic gait analyses using force plates and pressure mats, provide objective snap-shots of impairment 172,173 and the size and amenable nature of dogs make them suitable for such assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[173]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[174]</ref> .</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of miniaturized data recording technology has made telemetric accelerometry and activity monitoring practical in the clinical setting</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>175</head><p>. These objective assessments are cheaper and less complicated to use than force plates and offer easy longitudinal assessment for OA interventions and disease progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[174]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[175]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[176]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[177]</ref> . Many other tests could be useful in OA monitoring, including thermal imaging and mechanical nociceptive threshold testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">178,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">179</ref> . Functional activity monitoring, force plate analysis and advanced MRI are performed on dogs in a manner that mirrors their use in human patients, and brain imaging in conscious pet dogs is also reliable and practical, and could potentially be used for comparative neuroscience studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">180,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">181</ref> . . Dogs with spontaneous hip OA could therefore be good candidates for testing anti-hyperalgesia therapies while simultaneously experiencing the potential benefits. Overall, compelling evidence exists that veterinary randomized controlled trials (V-RCTs) in companion dogs with OA and chronic pain might reliably predict treatment efficacy in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">177,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">188</ref> . Parallel drug intervention studies are thus appropriate to accelerate therapeutic trials in dogs of drugs designed to treat pain in humans and might improve access to pain treatment not currently licensed in dogs, which could improve their welfare.</p><p>An intermediary between preclinical studies and clinical trials. The relatively short lifespan of a dog (~8-12 years) also enables end-of-life retrieval studies. Post-mortem retrieval of implant material from veterinary patients is relatively cheap and straightforward, and could provide additional insights into common surgical complications. Such samples have been used to examine the mechanical, histomorphologic and radiographic features of aseptic loosening, which is a particular 14 concern for total hip replacements in humans under the age of 50</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>208</head><p>. The results of one such study suggested that failure was initiated by poly(methyl methacrylate) de-bonding from the metal implant <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">206</ref> . Improved implant designs, if appropriately and ethically managed, could therefore be piloted in V-RCTs in dogs as they offer a comparatively short time-frame for implant retrieval compared with a human clinical trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remaining challenges of studying dogs</head><p>Accurately modelling pain in animals.</p><p>Pain is a cardinal symptom of OA, and symptomatic management of pain using a limited repertoire of drugs, . In the search for models of human pain, researchers also need to carefully consider the evolutionary role of pain responses. As prey, rodents are thought to show less overt signs of pain than predators such as humans and dogs. As signs of pain are common end points for measuring pain, fellow predator species are likely to more accurately represent human pain physiology than rodents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>15</head><p>Considering the important veterinary clinical desire to understand and manage pain in dogs with OA, potential exists for beneficial sharing of ideas between clinical researchers and veterinary researchers.</p><p>Reliability of veterinary data.</p><p>V-RCTs clearly differ from experimental animal research; they require ethical review and incentivisation, and longitudinal follow-up can be problematic. Ideally, data retrieval methods need to be non-invasive, nonharming and in line with clinical management, such as walking upon a pressure walkway or owner-assessed metrics. Non-invasive imaging, such as MRI, CT and arthroscopic imaging, can be highly informative but its A further issue is the throughput of veterinary studies; a disease might be common, but unlike many human health-care providers such as the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, the veterinary profession has historically been composed of many independent veterinarians, each of whom see a relatively small number of animals with a particular condition. However, the growth of multi-practice corporate ownership might promote uniformity in veterinary clinical approaches and increase the number of animals available for a study.</p><p>Initiatives such as the UK National Veterinary Canine Hip Replacement Registry 224 and the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium 10 are also seeking to improve the acquisition of animals with particular diseases, and more standardized clinical outcome assessments are slowly being adopted across veterinary groups</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>225</head><p>.</p><p>As with human trials, loss to follow-up and mid-trial exclusions also make obtaining suitable numbers of patients for analysis challenging. The lack of any centralized funding is also an issue, and veterinary medical care is essentially privately funded, which complicates the development of new therapies or research avenues. Research is currently further hampered by the fact that funding bodies often want results in a 1-2-year time frame, which is not feasible for OA outcome assessment.</p><p>Moreover, skepticism seems to exist concerning the variability in 'noisy' veterinary clinical data, compared with data from animal models that have controllable genetic backgrounds but poorly defined disease processes. Such attitudes ignore the fact that veterinary clinical studies very conveniently mirror the 'noise' encountered in human trials. Even when conducted well, it can be difficult to get good quality veterinary research published in high impact journals (perhaps partly due to lack of aspiration from the authors), which can slow the dissemination of research; the inclusion of veterinarians on scientific review boards could be advantageous to alter this trend. There is therefore, a great deal of potential and opportunity to develop veterinary research which could be highly informative and that will offer different advantages to animal model research and human clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>16</head><p>In this Review, we have sought to highlight the potential benefits for dog and human health that could follow the adoption of One Medicine approaches to basic and clinical research and practice for OA. Human and dog OA are heterogeneous and spontaneous, and we have emphasized some analogous forms of OA in which the dog is potentially the best model for the human counterpart and have also highlighted some homologies in underpinning OA disease mechanisms, similar co-morbidities and known distinctions. Much can be gained from studying a large animal with spontaneous OA, and understanding the reasons behind any differences will be just as informative as understanding the similarities.</p><p>We have consequently also sought to increase awareness of V-RCTs (a database is currently being developed by the American Veterinary Medical Association), national repositories of dog OA tissue samples, national retrieval banks for implants and V-RCT guidelines (including standardized outcome assessments to enable their amalgamation into an OA One Medicine paradigm). These resources have barely been exploited and their integration into research using a One Medicine approach could generate breakthroughs in OA treatment in dogs and humans, and in understanding how genetics, epigenetics, biomechanics and lifestyle affect OA aetiology and pathogenesis.</p></div>

Although the value of these rapidly changing rodent OA models should not be underestimated, naturally occurring disease in companion animals more closely reflects the complex genetic, physiological and environmental variation that occur in human OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> .</p><p>Spontaneous, slow-progressing OA occurs in multiple strains of mice, as well as in guinea pigs, Syrian hamsters, non-human primates and dogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> ; the histopathology and pathogenesis of dog OA most closely resemble those of primary human OA. Similar to humans, OA is also a common disease in the dog, with a prevalence that varies from 2.5% overall in UK veterinary primary care practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> to over 20% in dogs over 1 year old in the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> . The clinically affected dog shares complex naturally occurring traits and comorbidities, such as obesity, that occur in humans, and both humans and companion dogs live into old age, share environments and activities and often receive almost identical treatments, such as long-term administration of anti-inflammatory drugs or joint replacement surgery. Academic and private practice veterinary medicine can provide valuable biomedical research data, as referral centres are often equipped with MRI and CT scanners, arthroscopes and state-of-the-art pathology and molecular diagnostic capabilities. Academic veterinary centres also pilot advances in the use of anti-inflammatory and pain-modulating OA drug therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> . In this Review, we summarize research relating to common forms of spontaneous dog OA, focusing on the presentation and genetics of analogous diseases of the hip and knee, within a framework of human OA phenotypes. We also aim to encourage researchers to take on the principles of One Medicine research to benefit both humans and dogs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The dog as a model animal</head><p>The foreshortened lifespan of the dog, with its equivalent life stages to humans, holds potential for the longitudinal evaluation of disease and therapy in spontaneous OA ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Dog OA is generally considered to bear a close resemblance to human OA, with regards to anatomic similarity, disease heterogeneity and progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> . For example, changes in articular cartilage proteoglycans that occur in slowly progressive spontaneous dog OA (regardless of the age of the dog), closely match changes that occur in human OA but differ from those seen in rapidly advancing experimental dog OA induced by cruciate ligament transection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> .</p><p>Although clear anatomical similarities exist, extrapolating data from the quadrupedal dog to bipedal humans requires some caution. Indeed, the dog has comparatively reduced total joint forces that are split <ref type="bibr">60:40</ref> between the forelimbs and hindlimbs, in addition to a 20-degree flexion of the femur during the stance phase of gait, which together may have an unknown effect on OA development <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref> .</p><p>Intriguingly, distinct OA type-specific epidemiological patterns exist in dogs, notably between breeds, and OA is clearly influenced by body size, obesity, sex, neuter status and age <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> . Obesity, for instance, is a known risk factor for human <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19</ref> and dog OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref> , but evaluating its role as an independent risk factor in humans is difficult.</p><p>However, work with inbred experimental dog colonies has revealed that dietary restriction reduces OA. Six week-old sex-matched and body weight-matched pairs of Labrador Retriever litter mates from closed colonies were either control fed (ad libitum) or diet restricted (75% of control fed); radiographic hip OA was found in 25% of control-fed dogs and only 4% of diet-restricted dogs by 2 years, which increased to 39% versus 13% by 5 years and 83% versus 50% at 15 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> . Interestingly, diet restriction also extended longevity, and weight correlated only moderately with disease severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> , suggesting that other factors related to increased food intake might affect OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> . In other studies, diet restriction also reduced the severity and prevalence of shoulder <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref> and elbow OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24</ref> . Although the aetiology of obesity-related OA remains unclear, biomechanical effects from the overloading of weight-bearing joints have been proposed as a mechanism despite the fact that the risk of hand OA is also increased in obese humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25</ref> , which suggests a systemic role for obesity as a risk factor. An alternative mechanism in which adipose tissue promotes systemic low-grade inflammation via increased concentrations of adipokines has also been put forward <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26</ref> , and dog adipocytes are known to express important adipokines, suggesting that metabolic factors associated with being overweight or obese exert an independent risk of developing OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27</ref> .</p><p>Overall, although dog OA is likely to be more variable and takes longer to develop than rodent models of OA, and also requires larger numbers of animals to achieve appropriately powered study design than rodent studies, the study of naturally occurring dog OA could lead to a reduction in the number of animals used for experimental research and to a greater understanding of spontaneous OA. In the following sections we outline some common forms of naturally occurring dog OA and review their suitability as models for analogous human disease ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>

For example, femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), in which a thickened, aspherical femoral head-neck junction results in abutment against the acetabular labrum joint <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">38</ref> , is thought to be a common cause of human hip OA. By contrast, the existence of FAI in the dog is uncertain, although whether FAI has simply not been looked for, or is not specifically recognized in the dog, remains somewhat unclear.</p><p>Genetics.</p><p>DDH occurs in between 1 and 20 live births per 1,000 worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">44</ref> , and predisposing factors include family history, being a first born, female sex and breech birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">46</ref> . Familial segregation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">48</ref> suggest that DDH has a multifactorial genetic basis, but statistical support for this theory varies across populations and countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">49</ref> . For example, in a Chinese population, the recurrent risk of DDH in the siblings of affected individuals was approximately tenfold greater than in controls and had a heritability of ~85% <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">47</ref> . By contrast, the frequency of CHD varies between different dog breeds, reaching a peak of ~75% in Golden Retrievers and</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rottweilers</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>50</head><p>, and shows no sex predilection in most breeds; the exception is Polish Tatra Sheepdogs, in which the risk of CHD in females is greater than threefold the risk in males <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">41</ref> . This intra-breed and inter-breed variation is proving valuable in identifying the genetic basis of CHD. CHD demographics most closely mirror DDH in late-onset acetabular dysplasia41. CHD heritability ranges from 20% to 60% <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">51</ref> , and evidence from multipoint linkage studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">59</ref> suggest that 5-10 quantitative trait nucleotides of modest effect control CHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">60</ref> .</p><p>Approximately 15 genes with known functions in embryonic patterning and extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and remodelling have been associated with DDH and hip OA, predominantly via screening for candidate genetic polymorphisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">61</ref> . Many genetic associations lack replication, with the exception of CX3CR1</p><p>(encoding the G protein-coupled receptor CX3-chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1); also known as fractalkine), which was first identified by linkage mapping and exome sequencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">63</ref> , with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) being subsequently linked independently with DDH <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">64</ref> . CX3CR1 is involved in 5 mesenchymal stem cell recruitment to the joint <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">65</ref> , and Cx3cr1-knockout mice develop acetabular dysplasia <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">66</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>67</head><p>.</p><p>Whereas a genetic basis for DDH is likely, but not certain <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">68</ref> , it is undisputed in CHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">69</ref> .  <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">83</ref> . Analogous CCL transection is well documented to cause inflammation and reparative responses in the cartilage and synovium, yet ongoing instability prompts cartilage erosion and subchondral bone changes, thereby mirroring spontaneous knee OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">84</ref> . Spontaneous knee OA has a prevalence of ~20% in some breeds of dog <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">85</ref> , and ~50% of commonly affected breeds, such as Labrador Retrievers, develop contralateral knee CCL rupture within 1 year of diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">86</ref> . Despite its ubiquity, the underlying cause of breed predilection remains elusive; biological and biomechanical explanations have been suggested, including the slope of the tibial plateau, intercondylar fossa impingement, underlying immune-mediated pathology, hormonal influences and genetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">87</ref> . Notably, the spontaneous rupture of a dog CCL often occurs during normal activities, such as walking or running. By contrast, human ACL rupture occurs most commonly during sporting activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">88</ref> .</p><p>Although the underlying mechanisms of CCL pathology are undefined, predisposed dogs have thinner collagen fibrils in weaker CCLs that have increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 than those of cruciate disease-resistant breeds such as Greyhounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">82</ref> . Importantly, although ACL rupture in young humans is generally considered to be traumatic in cause, ~70% of macroscopically normal human ACLs also have histological evidence of pathology consistent with early degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">89</ref> .</p><p>Genetics.</p><p>Non-contact rupture of human ACL (such as occurs during pivoting and landing maneuvers when playing sport), as distinct from a direct high energy impact to the knee, has a complex etiology. As in the dog, variation in outcome is influenced by age, sex, genetics, obesity, muscle strength, activity and re-injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">90</ref> .</p><p>Young female athletes have a 3-6-fold higher risk of ACL injury compared with male counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">91</ref> .  <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">99</ref> . Genetic associations with human ACL rupture found a COL1A1 SNP that was replicated in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">100,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">102,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">104</ref> . A systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">100</ref> was followed by a GWAS that failed to reveal any ACL rupture-associated variants, highlighting the fact that replication and cross-species overlap will be mutually supportive in the investigation of complex traits.</p><p>Five-year-old dogs consistently have degenerative changes in their CCLs at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels ( . This lack of replication is probably caused by limitations similar to those for CHD. Functional studies that utilize relevant temporal tissue samples from dog OA at various stages to identify expression QTLs that overlap with genomic QTLs will be necessary to establish causation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure   2</ref>).</p><p>Dog CCL rupture as a model for human ACL rupture.</p><p>Spontaneous CCL rupture might be analogous to experimental transection in dogs, as osteophytes and sclerosis develop at an early stage81 and end-stage OA develops over several years <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">109,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">110</ref> ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 4d</ref>). However, the aetiology is likely to differ, as the dog CCL ruptures at its mid-substance during normal activity, and is often linked with prior degeneration and moderate to severe OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">87</ref> . Although CCL transection induces 8 synovitis, lymphocytic-plasmacytic synovitis also occurs in spontaneous CCL rupture <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">111,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">112</ref> . , dog joints with CCL rupture also exhibit an M1 macrophage polarization, whereas M2 macrophages predominate in healthy joints <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">115</ref> . The predictability of contralateral disease development in dogs with ruptured CCLs has also offered unique opportunities for biomarker studies, which have revealed an increase in IL-8 concentrations in synovial fluid prior to CCL failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">116</ref> . Changes identifiable on MRIs of partially ruptured dog CCLs might also improve our understanding of OA progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">100</ref> . However, owing to the differing pathogenesis of rupture, it remains to be seen whether changes predicted by incipient contralateral disease in dogs are recapitulated in human OA.</p><p>Comparisons between OA associated with dog CCL rupture and human ACL rupture might also help to explain the relationships that exist between hormonal status and OA. Estrogen reduces collagen synthesis in fibroblasts from human ACLs in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">119</ref> , and the risk of ACL rupture in female human athletes is increased on the first days of the menstrual cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">120</ref> . Likewise, the commonplace neutering of dogs increases CCL rupture risk, as does being female and being overweight <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">121</ref> . Hence, examination of the at-risk female dog might offer insight into the function of hormones or post-neutering weight gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">105</ref> . A more complete understanding of the similarities and differences in OA related to dog CCL rupture and human ACL rupture might unveil the hormonal influences that underpin the markedly higher primary human knee OA incidence in post-menopausal females than in age-matched men <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">123</ref> .</p><p>We are not arguing that human and dog cruciate ligament rupture have identical inciting causes, nor identical management strategies (Box 3), but instead aim to highlight that both involve mechanical instability and intractable progression to knee OA, thereby making simultaneous research in both species potentially beneficial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other conditions of interest</head><p>Osteochondritis dessicans.</p><p>Dog shoulders develop both age-related primary OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> and osteochondrosis, which presents as osteochondritis dessicans lesions 124 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 5</ref>) that are characterised by disordered endochondral ossification superimposed upon previously normal growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">[125]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">[126]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">[127]</ref> .

Intriguingly, male humans are also more frequently affected with osteochondrosis, and bilateral disease is also common <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">129,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">130</ref> .</p><p>Unilateral osteochondrosis in young dogs enables tissue samples to be collected of early contralateral lesions 9 and arthroscopic autologous or biomaterial articular resurfacing to be carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">132</ref> .

Earlier physeal closure in small breeds is consistent with more rapid growth, and potential predisposition to osteochondritis dessicans.</p><p>Growth plates in large breeds, such as Great Danes, have an expanded hypertrophic region and more active bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-BMP6 signalling than miniature breeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">135</ref> , suggesting that studies of osteochondritis dessicans could provide unique insights into the function of longitudinal bone growth in these disease processes. Another possible connection has emerged from studies that established direct links between genetic selection for high growth rates, failure of mechano-adaptive bone changes and predisposition to skeletal diseases in other species <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">126</ref> . Whether similar relationships persist in dogs and humans has yet to be explored.</p><p>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.</p><p>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD), a form of avascular necrosis of the femoral head, involves slow femoral head destruction in children.

Bilateral hip OA is common in human LCPD, peaking at 4-8 years of age, and occurs ~4 times more frequently in boys than in girls <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">138</ref> . By contrast, no sex-bias for LCPD exists in dogs and the trait is often unilateral <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">124</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A One Medicine approach</head><p>The idea that OA is not one disease, but a syndrome encompassing heterogeneous, stratified groups of patients with characteristic aetiologies has been gaining acceptance. This shift in thinking has led to an increased appreciation that the development of new targeted therapeutic approaches might be accelerated by patient stratification on the basis of phenotype (or endotype), which might also improve alignment with preclinical animal models. An initial attempt at disease stratification of patients with knee OA proposed five OA phenotypes, defined by the severity of joint involvement, muscle strength, obesity and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">149</ref> . A subsequent systematic review 150 identified six phenotypic groups: those with central chronic pain sensitization; inflammation; systemic metabolic changes; bone and/or cartilage remodelling; mechanical overload with varus deformity and compartment diseases; and minimally symptomatic OA. OARSI recommends five clinically distinct phenotypes that are based on presentation with pain sensitization, psychological distress, radiographic severity, body mass index, muscle strength, inflammation and comorbidities <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">151</ref> . Another systematic review of knee OA identified sex, obesity and other metabolic abnormalities, cartilage damage patterns and inflammation as variables upon which distinct structural OA phenotypes could be delineated <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">152</ref> . We conjecture that the common dog OA types we have highlighted herein provide models for ready alignment with human OA on the basis of anatomy, aetiology and pathophysiology <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 1)</ref>, and propose a system for their use with a view to analogous human OA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advantages of studying spontaneous clinical disease in dogs</head><p>Is there any prospect that the study of dog OA might accelerate new developments in human OA? Currently, cancer research is the field that has most readily adopted and successfully applied a One Medicine approach.</p><p>Cancers account for &gt;25% of dog mortalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">153</ref>  A source of tissue for research.</p><p>From the examples provided in the proposed OA sub-categorization <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">(Table 1)</ref> . Similarly, resected osteoarthritic femoral heads and synovium from hip replacement procedures could be used to facilitate a greater understanding of OA mechanisms, and could perhaps be used to improve diagnostic and prognostic criteria. A means to identify the genetic basis of analogous disease.</p><p>The study of purebred dogs lends itself to the genetic analysis of complex diseases such as hip dysplasia, osteochondritis dessicans and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Residual blood collected for routine haematology or biochemistry tests in the clinic could be used for many purposes, including as a source of DNA for genetic research; removed tissues could also be utilised for such studies. Making use of the broad linkage disequilibrium introduced by selective breeding in breeds with a high predilection for a disease compared with breeds with a low predilection for a disease will help to identify common candidate disease-associated genes in these polygenetic conditions.</p><p>A source of clinically applicable functional outcome measures.</p><p>One clear difference between dogs and humans is the ability to self-report pain. As subjective pain measures can be readily quantified in humans, objective data has been used sparingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">163</ref> . Instead, clinical metrology instruments and a patient-centred approach to outcome assessment has become a mainstay in the assessment of human OA. A patient-centered approach has also been incorporated into veterinary assessments; clinical metrology instruments and validated outcome questionnaires are used to capture painrelated behaviour over long periods of time in home environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">164</ref> and pet owners can provide proxy assessments, just as parents or care-givers would for young children or adults with dementia <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[165]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[166]</ref> . Although objective assessment methods are less readily available than proxy reporting, these instruments have been validated, are cheap, are straightforward to use, the data they produce is easy to analyze and they do not have the relevancy issues associated with proxy reporting. Instruments such as the Canine Brief Pain Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[167]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[168]</ref> , which is analogous to the human Brief Pain Inventory have the potential to expand the ability to gain outcome assessment data from veterinary clinical trials. Such inventories (including the Liverpool OA , which has led to objective force plate outcome measurement becoming a common gold standard for functional assessment in dogs. Kinematic evaluation, as well as the more commonly used kinetic gait analyses using force plates and pressure mats, provide objective snap-shots of impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">172,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b195">173</ref> and the size and amenable nature of dogs make them suitable for such assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">[173]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[174]</ref> .</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of miniaturized data recording technology has made telemetric accelerometry and activity monitoring practical in the clinical setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">175</ref> . These objective assessments are cheaper and less complicated to use than force plates and offer easy longitudinal assessment for OA interventions and disease progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">[174]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">[175]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">[176]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">[177]</ref> . Many other tests could be useful in OA monitoring, including thermal imaging and mechanical nociceptive threshold testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">178,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">179</ref> . Functional activity monitoring, force plate analysis and advanced MRI are performed on dogs in a manner that mirrors their use in human patients, and brain imaging in conscious pet dogs is also reliable and practical, and could potentially be used for comparative neuroscience studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">180,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">181</ref> .</p><p>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), a method of quantifying pain, has been used to demonstrate central sensitization in human OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b204">182,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">183</ref> , experimental dog OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">184</ref> and spontaneous dog OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">185</ref> . QST has also been used to demonstrate the efficacy of dog total hip replacements for reversing hyperalgesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">190</ref> , as occurs in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">187</ref> . Dogs with spontaneous hip OA could therefore be good candidates for testing anti-hyperalgesia therapies while simultaneously experiencing the potential benefits. Overall, compelling evidence exists that veterinary randomized controlled trials (V-RCTs) in companion dogs with OA and chronic pain might reliably predict treatment efficacy in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">168,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">177,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">188</ref> . Parallel drug intervention studies are thus appropriate to accelerate therapeutic trials in dogs of drugs designed to treat pain in humans and might improve access to pain treatment not currently licensed in dogs, which could improve their welfare.</p><p>An intermediary between preclinical studies and clinical trials.</p><p>Dog OA is ideally suited for V-RCTs because of the rigor of the functional outcome measures used. A study in which peak vertical force (PVF) and accelerometer data were compared to continuously track activity at home in dogs with spontaneous CCL disease showed excellent between-session reliability that aligned well with locomotor activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">189</ref> . These results indicate that PVF and accelerometry are robust, reliable and include treatment with anti-nerve growth factor antibodies in dogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">177</ref> and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">191</ref> and the use of novel anti-inflammatory agents, such as resiniferatoxin and the combination of licofelone and doxycycline, which were similarly effective in dogs with spontaneous OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b214">[192]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">[193]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">[194]</ref> and in patients with OA in phase III trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">195,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">196</ref> .</p><p>Intra-articular hyaluronan injection in humans with OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">197</ref> and in dogs with CHD 198 also showed comparable short-term symptomatic benefit without structure-modifying efficacy.</p><p>One example of how dog OA studies have proved useful in a One Medicine approach is in trials of stem cell therapy, which have advanced more rapidly in dogs than in humans. Allogenic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells harvested from visceral adipose surgical waste from ovariectomy procedures have been combined with hyaluronan and injected intra-articularly into osteoarthritic dog elbow joints, leading to reduced lameness and the regeneration of hyaline-type cartilage <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">199</ref> . In another study, the measurement of PVF and vertical impulse using force platforms showed transitory improvement in severe hip OA after intraarticular administration of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells The relatively short lifespan of a dog (~8-12 years) also enables end-of-life retrieval studies. Post-mortem retrieval of implant material from veterinary patients is relatively cheap and straightforward, and could provide additional insights into common surgical complications. Such samples have been used to examine the mechanical, histomorphologic and radiographic features of aseptic loosening, which is a particular concern for total hip replacements in humans under the age of 50 <ref type="bibr">208</ref> . The results of one such study suggested that failure was initiated by poly(methyl methacrylate) de-bonding from the metal implant <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">206</ref> . Improved implant designs, if appropriately and ethically managed, could therefore be piloted in V-RCTs in dogs as they offer a comparatively short time-frame for implant retrieval compared with a human clinical trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remaining challenges of studying dogs</head><p>Accurately modelling pain in animals.</p><p>Pain is a cardinal symptom of OA, and symptomatic management of pain using a limited repertoire of drugs, including analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents, is central in both veterinary <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">207</ref> and human clinical Similarities in neurophysiology across mammals strongly suggest that the pain experienced in humans and animals is analogous <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">210</ref> . However, pain experiences in OA are complicated and involve peripheral nociceptive sensitization, structural changes to joint innervation, central nervous system sensitization, neuropathic changes and a host of mediators, as well as simple nociceptive input from damaged joint tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">212</ref> . Pain severity correlates poorly with radiographic structural changes in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">213</ref> or dogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">214</ref> with OA. The development of new therapies for pain in OA will therefore require effective models that recapitulate the joint changes that occur in OA, as well as the clinical symptoms.</p><p>Levels of pain in OA are influenced by synovitis, osteochondral pathology and sensitization, which are not accounted for by structural radiographic changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">212,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">215</ref> . Good models of OA therefore need to reflect the longitudinal natural history of human OA phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">[216]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">[217]</ref> . This premise is perhaps most elegantly demonstrated in studies of spontaneous dog OA in which advanced non-invasive imaging has revealed evidence of disease progression similar to some human OA phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b239">216,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b240">217</ref> . Indeed, powerful, reliable and validated semi-quantitative MRI approaches have already been used in multicentre clinical trials in patients with OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">218,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b242">219</ref> . The presence, number and size of bone marrow lesions (identified by characteristic MRI signal intensity changes) have been linked to the severity of pain in patients with OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b243">220</ref> . Natural animal models for bone marrow lesions are clearly required, and indeed, bone marrow lesion-like structures with focal articular cartilage changes have been linked with disability in the dog CCL transection model of OA and in dogs with spontaneous CCL-rupture-induced OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b244">221,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">222</ref> . In the search for models of human pain, researchers also need to carefully consider the evolutionary role of pain responses. As prey, rodents are thought to show less overt signs of pain than predators such as humans and dogs. As signs of pain are common end points for measuring pain, fellow predator species are likely to more accurately represent human pain physiology than rodents.</p><p>Considering the important veterinary clinical desire to understand and manage pain in dogs with OA, potential exists for beneficial sharing of ideas between clinical researchers and veterinary researchers.</p><p>Reliability of veterinary data.</p><p>V-RCTs clearly differ from experimental animal research; they require ethical review and incentivisation, and longitudinal follow-up can be problematic. Ideally, data retrieval methods need to be non-invasive, nonharming and in line with clinical management, such as walking upon a pressure walkway or owner-assessed metrics. Non-invasive imaging, such as MRI, CT and arthroscopic imaging, can be highly informative but its use is often limited by cost and the need to show a clinical indication. Excellent V-RCTs are possible, but require careful planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">223</ref> .</p><p>A further issue is the throughput of veterinary studies; a disease might be common, but unlike many human health-care providers such as the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, the veterinary profession has historically been composed of many independent veterinarians, each of whom see a relatively small number of animals with a particular condition. However, the growth of multi-practice corporate ownership might promote uniformity in veterinary clinical approaches and increase the number of animals available for a study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Initiatives such as the UK National Veterinary Canine Hip Replacement Registry 224 and the Comparative</head><p>Oncology Trials Consortium 10 are also seeking to improve the acquisition of animals with particular diseases, and more standardized clinical outcome assessments are slowly being adopted across veterinary groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b249">225</ref> .</p><p>As with human trials, loss to follow-up and mid-trial exclusions also make obtaining suitable numbers of patients for analysis challenging. The lack of any centralized funding is also an issue, and veterinary medical care is essentially privately funded, which complicates the development of new therapies or research avenues. Research is currently further hampered by the fact that funding bodies often want results in a 1-2-year time frame, which is not feasible for OA outcome assessment.</p><p>Moreover, skepticism seems to exist concerning the variability in 'noisy' veterinary clinical data, compared with data from animal models that have controllable genetic backgrounds but poorly defined disease processes. Such attitudes ignore the fact that veterinary clinical studies very conveniently mirror the 'noise' encountered in human trials. Even when conducted well, it can be difficult to get good quality veterinary research published in high impact journals (perhaps partly due to lack of aspiration from the authors), which can slow the dissemination of research; the inclusion of veterinarians on scientific review boards could be advantageous to alter this trend. There is therefore, a great deal of potential and opportunity to develop veterinary research which could be highly informative and that will offer different advantages to animal model research and human clinical trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this Review, we have sought to highlight the potential benefits for dog and human health that could follow the adoption of One Medicine approaches to basic and clinical research and practice for OA. Human and dog OA are heterogeneous and spontaneous, and we have emphasized some analogous forms of OA in which the dog is potentially the best model for the human counterpart and have also highlighted some homologies in underpinning OA disease mechanisms, similar co-morbidities and known distinctions. Much can be gained from studying a large animal with spontaneous OA, and understanding the reasons behind any differences will be just as informative as understanding the similarities.</p><p>We have consequently also sought to increase awareness of V-RCTs (a database is currently being developed </p></div>

Dogs typically live into old age, come in a variety of shapes and sizes (from highly athletic to sedentary and overweight) and live in close proximity to humans. As dogs develop many age-related chronic diseases and comorbidities on a foreshortened timescale (breed-influenced life expectancy is ~8-12 years) that are analogous to those in humans, there is a growing view that developing our understanding and treatment of dog osteoarthritis (OA) could lead to breakthroughs in human OA <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">153</ref> .</p></div>

Radiographic images show a human total hip replacement using an uncemented stem and cup (see the figure, part a) and a dog total hip replacement using a cemented stem and uncemented cup (see the <ref type="figure">figure, part b)</ref>. Trait similarities and a relatively truncated dog lifespan will probably make the discovery of common early features of hip osteoarthritis (OA) more rapid in dogs with CHD than in humans with DDH.

This divergence in surgical approaches might be a result of the smaller size of canine joints, the suitability of autografts, suboptimal materials or, perhaps, surgical expertise. However, fundamental biomechanical disparities between dog CCLs and human ACLs might also be important. Dogs have a more sloped tibial plateau <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">82</ref> and flexed standing angle than humans, which creates greater continuous biomechanical cruciate ligament strain than the upright bipedal human stance with its flatter tibial plateau.</p><p>The synovitis associated with dog CCL degeneration could potentially also affect graft survival.

For example, such an approach could involve an exploration of whether two distinct subgroups of patients with symptomatic knee OA exist in dogs on the basis of inflammatory gene expression profiles in peripheral blood leukocytes 157 , or of whether dogs have alternative metabolic or cell senescent 'mechanistic' OA phenotypes 152 . In addition, clinical samples such as fragments of osteochondritis dessicans lesions, resected ruptured CCL remnants, excised damaged menisci, or plasma, urine or synovial fluid samples could be retrieved for biomarker assessment as part of the clinical disease management of a dog. Dogs with unilateral CCL disease often have premonitory radiographic and clinical signs of synovial effusion and partial CCL tears are often associated with painful lameness in affected dogs, even when instability is minimal. Measuring soluble biomarkers in biological fluids might therefore facilitate early diagnosis or evaluation of interventions 158</figDesc></figure>

Box 1. One Health, One Medicine and veterinary medicine. The One Health concept, in which human health is recognized as being closely connected to animal health and the environment, dates back to Hippocrates and Aristotle. Claude Bourgelat, a founder of 18th century veterinary medicine, advocated this intimacy 226 , which was further emphasized by the 19th century physician Rudolf Virchow, who coined the term 'zoonosis' upon discovering that Trichinella spiralis from pigs causes human neurocysticercosis 227 . Despite historical recognition of the One Health concept, a culture of marked anthropocentricity emerged during the 1970s, shifting research emphasis towards induced, experimental animal models of disease. One Health approaches regained momentum following outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in 1996 and of corona virus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Distinct from One Health, One Medicine is now emerging as a holistic paradigm wherein veterinary and human medical researchers and clinical practitioners collaborate to increase their understanding of shared diseases and to develop new therapies228.

. CHD-associated loci 

identified by a GWAS of Labrador Retrievers in the UK (&gt;1,000 dogs) include those on canine chromosome 

01 (CFA01) and CFA21 ( 

55 

). Another GWAS that used several breeds of dog identified an SNP in CTBP2 on 

CFA28 that was linked to CHD, specifically the Norberg angle 

52 

. This SNP and SNPs at two more loci near 

TRIM2 and DPP4 were subsequently associated with CHD in a post hoc analysis of the same data 

53 

. However, 

similar to genetic studies of DDH, GWAS of CHD have also been difficult to replicate across different breeds 

and laboratories 

55 

. Large-scale association studies indicate that the vast majority of significantly associated 

variants reside outside of protein-coding exons, which make up only 1.2% of the human genome 

71 

, a situation 

that is likely to be similar in the dog genome. Because not all structural variants, including deletions, 

duplications, inversions and translocations, in non-coding regions of the genome might be tagged by an SNP, 

genetic causes of complex trait variation will often be missed in GWAS. For example, in a study of 4,200 

genotyped dogs, most variants were poorly tagged by markers in a high-density mapping array of &gt;180,000 

markers 

52 

; other previous canine GWAS are also likely to have causal variant mutations. Whole genome 

sequencing and genotype imputation are probably needed to capture all causal mutations in canine GWAS. 

Intriguingly, in a 2014 study, three human patients with sporadic DDH shared an identical frameshift 

mutation in ZRANB1 

63 

, which is notable, as ZRANB1 is in the same canine linkage disequilibrium interval as 

the CTBP2 SNP on CFA28 

52 

. A locus on CFA37 in Bernese Mountain dogs has also been associated with CHD 

and lies near to FN1, which is associated with human DDH 

59 

. These genetic similarities indicate that studying 

CHD in selected breeds of dogs such as Labrador and Golden Retrievers or Rottweilers could yield novel 

mechanistic insights into the aetiopathology of hip dysplasia in dogs and humans (Figure 2). As strong 

evidence exists for similarities in the phenotype and progression of secondary OA in dysplastic hip joints in 

humans and dogs, parallel genomic, transcriptomic and methylomic biomarker analyses in both species are 

likely to be highly informative. Fresh samples can be retrieved readily from dogs undergoing joint salvage 

procedures, which could facilitate transcriptional screening to overcome the replication barrier, as genetic 

associations are likely to have been previously missed. 

Using CHD as a means to understand DDH. 

Does CHD occur with sufficient predictability to provide a feasible model for DDH? CHD occurs with 75% 

prevalence in Golden Retrievers and Rottweilers 

50 

. As in humans, this high prevalence has heralded early-

6 

stage hip laxity screening in these breeds 
72 and health improvement programmes that include novel laxity 

measures (the PennHIP distraction view to calculate the distraction index), which enable the identification 

of dogs at the age of 4 months that are highly unlikely to develop OA by the age of 3 years 

73 

. CHD resembles 

DDH clinically and pathologically but progresses over a compressed time frame, adding to its utility as a 

model. Many dog screening programmes and registries employ traditional hip extended pelvic radiography 

(Figure 3a), and some have DNA banks (such as the Canine Health Foundation of the American Kennel Club), 

which presents an opportunity to identify genetic, epigenetic or environmental factors common to DDH and 

CDH. The phenotypic characteristics of these two diseases are similar enough to warrant simultaneous 

clinical and basic research to augment progress in treatment and prevention of dog and human hip OA 

secondary to dysplasia. Current treatment strategies for hip dysplasia in dogs and humans are highlighted in 

Box 2. Researchers have also explored the role of fetal movement in the development of bone shape in 

patients with DDH using MRI74. Although the cost of such MRI studies is currently prohibitive in dogs, the 

possibility of a One Medicine approach to advance research in this field by careful fetal tracking of the 

developmental emergence of joint incongruity in DDH and CDH is worth considering. 

Knee cruciate ligament rupture 

Presentation. 

Dog knees have human-like anatomy 
75 including an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) that is termed the cranial 

cruciate ligament (CCL) in dogs owing to their quadrupedal arrangement (Figure 4). Experimentally, dogs 

have been used for several surgical models of OA, including CCL transection 

4 

, partial transection 

76 

, synovial 

debridement 

76 

, transarticular impact 

77 

, tibial osteotomy 

78 

, meniscal sectioning 
11 and articular cartilage 

scarification 

79 

. In humans, ACL rupture can lead to OA 

80 

, and the same is true in dogs 

81 

. Spontaneous CCL 

rupture (Figure 4b, d and h) is common in dogs, and certain breeds such as West Highland White Terriers, 

Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Retrievers and Rottweilers are particularly predisposed

. Dog joints enable 

longitudinal study using modern imaging techniques such as CT, MRI, arthroscopy, serial force plate analysis 

and tissue sampling, and have the potential to reveal additional insights into OA at early and late stages 

compared with mouse models of OA, in which such evaluations are not technically feasible. Indeed, tissue 

sampling could be included as part of a clinical trial as soon as clinical, radiographic, CT or MRI evidence of 

abnormal joint architecture is identified. Gaining usable samples of sufficient quantity is a practical possibility 

when working with dogs with spontaneous OA through schemes such as the Cornell Veterinary Biobank or 

Vetmeduni Vienna's Biobank.

This technique remains a preferred approach and contrasts markedly with the current management of human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, for which grafting reconstruction techniques still dominate</figDesc><table>Both dogs and humans have similar bone remodelling characteristics

treatments for CHD and DDH use similar clinical and functional measures, including gait analysis and 

accelerometer measurements, validated clinical questionnaires and imaging techniques

Box 3. Clinical treatment of knee cruciate ligament rupture. 

Surgical repair for cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture was initially based on a modification of the Hey-

Groves human repair process. A strip of autograft lateral fascia was tunnelled within the joint to mimic the 

defective CCL (the so-called Paatsama procedure) and was advocated for use in dogs in the 1950s
