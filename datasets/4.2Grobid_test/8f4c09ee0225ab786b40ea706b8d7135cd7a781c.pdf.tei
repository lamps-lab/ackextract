<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background/Aims: Following lead optimization, a set of substituted imidazopyridines was identified as potent and selective inhibitors of in vitro HCV replication. The particular characteristics of one of the most potent compounds in this series (5-[[3-(4- [4,5-c]pyridine or GS-327073), were studied.</p><p>Methods: Antiviral activity of GS-327073 was evaluated in HCV subgenomic replicons (genotypes 1b, 1a and 2a), in the JFH1 (genotype 2a) infectious system and against replicons resistant to various selective HCV inhibitors. Combination studies of GS-327073 with other selective HCV inhibitors were performed.</p><p>Results: Fifty percent effective concentrations for inhibition of HCV subgenomic 1b replicon replication ranged between 2 and 50 nM and were 100-fold higher for HCV genotype 2a virus. The 50% cytostatic concentrations were P17 lM, thus resulting in selectivity indices of P340. GS-327073 retained wild-type activity against HCV replicons that were resistant to either HCV protease inhibitors or several polymerase inhibitors. GS-327073, when combined with either interferon a, ribavirin, a nucleoside polymerase or a protease inhibitor resulted in overall additive antiviral activity. Combinations containing GS-327073 proved highly effective in clearing hepatoma cells from HCV.</p><p>Conclusions: GS-327073 is a potent in vitro inhibitor of HCV replication either alone or in combination with other selective HCV inhibitors.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>An estimated 170-180 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HCV and are thus at increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver failure and end-stage liver disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The current standard therapy, i.e. pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, is associated with significant side-effects; moreover, a sustained virological response is (depending on the genotype) obtained in only 50-60% of the patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Hence, there is an urgent need for new potent, selective and safe drugs for the treatment of HCV infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>Several potent and selective inhibitors of HCV replication, most of which target the NS3 protease and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), have been developed in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Other viral (such as NS4A) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and cellular targets (such as cyclophylins) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> involved in the HCV lifecycle are also being explored. The efficacy of a number of inhibitors has been or is being studied in patients chronically infected with HCV <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>Both nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of the HCV RdRp have been reported. Nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitors act as premature chain terminators following conversion to their 5 0 -triphosphate metabolite and incorporation in the viral genome. 2 0 -C-Methylcytidine (2 0 -C-MeCyt) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> was the first nucleoside HCV inhibitor to enter clinical studies. Development of this compound has been discontinued in the light of modest antiviral efficacy along with significant gastrointestinal side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. The efficacy of R1626, a prodrug of 4 0 -azidocytidine, is currently being evaluated in combination with standard therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. b-D-2 0 -Deoxy-2 0 -fluoro-2 0 -C-methylcytidine (prodrug R7128) has demonstrated promising efficacy in phase I studies in chronically infected patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.

Efficacy of the benzofuran non-nucleoside RdRp inhibitor (HCV-796) was demonstrated in infected patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> but clinical development was stopped because of potential hepatotoxicity. VCH-759, a new non-nucleoside thiophene-2-carboxylic acid inhibitor of RdRp causes a 2.5 log 10 decrease in HCV RNA after 10 days of treatment in HCV-infected patients and was generally well-tolerated in early clinical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>We recently reported a novel class of substituted imidazopyridines capable of selectively inhibiting HCV replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. The analogue 2-(2-fluorophenyl)-5-[4-bromobenzyl]-5H-imidazo <ref type="bibr">[4,5-c]</ref>pyridine served as the starting point for further lead optimization, which resulted in the discovery of a series of highly potent inhibitors of in vitro HCV replication.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco, Merelbeke, Belgium) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (Integro, Zaandam, The Netherlands), 1Â MEM non essential amino acids solution without L-glutamine (Gibco), 100 IU of penicillin/ml and 100 lg of streptomycin/ml (Gibco) and 1 mg/ml G418 (GeneticinÒ Selective Antibiotic, Gibco) for Huh 9-13 and HuH6 or 250 lg/ml G418 for Huh 5-2 cells. Huh-Lunet cells were cultured without G418. Replicons resistant to the protease inhibitors BILN-2061 and VX-950, the nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 4 0 -azidocytidine and 2 0 -C-MeCyt, or the non-nucleoside RdRP inhibitor benzothiadiazine (GSK-4) were generated by selective pressure using increasing concentrations of the respective compounds.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">chlorophenyl)-5-isoxazolyl]methyl]- 2-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-5H-imidazo</formula></div>

Antiviral assays were carried out as reported earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Read-out for Huh 5-2 cells was a luciferase assay, quantification of viral RNA in Huh 9-13 and HuH6 was performed by means of real-time PCR. For Huh 5-2 cells, the EC 50 was defined as the concentration of compound that reduced the firefly luciferase signal by 50%; for Huh 9-13 and HuH6 cells as the concentration of compound that reduced the amount of HCV RNA by 50%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Antiviral assays with HCVcc virus</head><p>A J6/JFH chimeric HCV reporter virus (J6/JFH-Rluc2a-FLAG) was constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. Infectious virus stocks were generated by transfecting in vitro transcribed RNA into Huh-Lunet cells and harvesting culture medium from the transfected cells. To test antiviral activity of compounds against this chimeric 2a virus, Huh-Lunet cells in 96-well plates (5000 cells per well) were infected with the virus (MOI = 0.1) after which serial dilutions of compounds were added. After three days of incubation, medium was removed, cells were washed once with PBS and lysed using a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Viral replication was monitored by measuring Renilla luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI), or by RNA extraction and real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Antiviral data were fit to the logistic dose response equation y = a/(1 + (x/b) c ) using XLFit software (IDBS, Emmeryville, CA), and EC 50 values were calculated from the resulting equations as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p></div>

The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> ), which is defined as the concentration that inhibits the proliferation of exponentially growing cells by 50%, was determined using the MTS/PMS method previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">Drug combinations</head><p>The effects of drug-drug combinations were studied in HuH6 cells, in which replicon replication is largely independent of cell proliferation (which is important when planning combination studies with a cytostatic drug such as ribavirin) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. Cells were seeded in complete DMEM without G418 and compounds were added to the cells in the cell culture plates in checkerboard format. Combinations for each pair of compounds were at least performed in three independent experiments. Data were evaluated using the method of Prichard and Shipman <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Briefly, the theoretical additive effect is calculated from the dose-response curves of individual compounds by the equation Z = X + Y(1 À X), where X represents the inhibition produced by compound 1 and Y represents that of compound 2. Z represents the effect produced by the combination of compound 1 and compound 2. The theoretical additive surface is subtracted from the actual experimental surface, resulting in a horizontal surface that equals the zero plane when the combination is additive. Data points more than 20% above the zero plane indicate synergistic activity, data points lower than 20% under the zero plane indicate antagonistic activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">HCV replicon clearance-rebound assay</head><p>Huh 9-13 cells were seeded in 25 cm 2 culture flasks at a cell density of 3 Â 10 5 cells per condition; a sample of 1.5 Â 10 5 Huh 9-13 cells was collected in RLT buffer (RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) [''Clearance 0" sample] and stored at À80°C until further use. Cells were cultured for 24 h, after which standard cell culture medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 was replaced with medium that contained either no antiviral drug or various concentrations of GS-327073, IFNa 2b, 2 0 -C-MeCyt or VX-950 (all conditions in the absence of G418). Cells were incubated until 90% confluency was reached. Cells were subsequently subcultured at a density of 3 Â 10 5 per 25 cm 2 culture flask containing the same concentration of antiviral drug without G418 (clearance ''C x ") or were subcultured in culture medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 in the absence of antiviral drug (rebound ''R x "). At every subculture step a sample of 1.5 Â 10 5 cells was lysed in RLT buffer and stored at À80°C. After collection of all samples, RNA was extracted and samples were analyzed by quantitative realtime PCR for their HCV replicon content. Real-time RT-PCR values of all assayed samples were normalized against the ''no-drug control" of the same passage. Cells were cultured under clearance and rebound conditions for 3 passages and 4 passages, respectively. Cells that had lost the replicon died in the presence of G418 during the rebound; cells that still contained the replicon were able to survive under G418 pressure.</p></div>

Introduction of a fluorine at position 2 of the phenyl of the lead anti-pestivirus compound 5-[4-bromophenyl)methyl]-2-phenyl-5H-imidazo <ref type="bibr">[4,5-c]</ref>pyridine (BPIP) resulted in a molecule that not only exhibited anti-BVDV but also anti-HCV activity (compound 1; EC 50 HCV = 3.0 lM; CC 50 = 136 lM) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. Introduction of two fluorines on the 2-phenyl ring (2,3-difluoro analogue; compound 2) resulted in a molecule that proved 5-fold more potent against HCV than compound 1 and that retained the anti-BVDV activity. In an attempt to further optimize the anti-HCV activity of this class of compounds, a set of analogues with modifications to the 4-bromo substituent on the 5-benzyl residue (for example the introduction of a trifluoromethyl; compounds 3 and 4) was synthesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, resulting in compounds with a 15-to 30-fold increased anti-HCV activity as compared to compound 1. Interestingly, whereas these modifications resulted in an increased anti-HCV activity, there was relatively little effect on BVDV activity. Subsequently, a set of analogues with more extensive modifications at the 5-benzyl position was synthesized (data not shown). This resulted in the identification of a series of analogues with highly potent low nM range anti-HCV activity. One of these, i.e. GS-327073 or 5- <ref type="bibr">[4,5-c]</ref>pyridine, was selected for further characterization of the in vitro anti-HCV activity. The compound inhibited HCV (genotype 1) subgenomic replicon replication with mean EC 50 values ranging between 2 and 50 nM in a dose-dependent manner <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table  1,</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 2</ref>). GS-327073 proved markedly more potent than the protease inhibitors BILN-2061, VX-950 and SCH 503034, the nucleoside polymerase inhibitors 2 0 -CMeCyt and 4 0 -azidocytidine and the non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor GSK-4. GS-327073 inhibited the replication of cell culture-grown chimeric HCV (HCVcc, genotype 2a) designated J6/JFH-Rluc-FLAG in a dosedependent manner, although less efficiently than the replication of genotype 1b replicon. The antiviral activity of GS-327073 against the J6/JFH-Rluc-FLAG virus was however comparable to the activity of the reference protease or polymerase inhibitors studied.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[[3-(4-chloro- phenyl)-5-isoxazolyl]methyl]-2-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-5H- imidazo</formula><p>GS-327073 also inhibited BVDV replication, although about 10-fold less potent than compound 1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">GS-327073 in combination with interferon, protease or polymerase inhibitors results in an additive antiviral activity</head><p>Combination experiments were performed in HuH6 replicon-containing cells in which replicon replication is largely independent of cell proliferation. This is important since the reference drugs 2 0 -C-MeCyt and ribavirin, at the concentrations used, inhibit host cell proliferation. GS-327073 was combined (in checkerboard format) with either IFNa 2b, VX-950, ribavirin or 2 0 -C-MeCyt, and data were analyzed using the method of Prichard and Shipman <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Each combination resulted overall in an additive antiviral activity <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 3)</ref>. A slight synergistic effect was observed when GS-327073 was combined with low concentrations of IFNa 2b.</p></div>

GS-327073 or VX-950, when used at concentrations of five times their EC <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> , resulted in a rapid and profound drop in replicon level but did not achieve complete clearance of Huh 9-13 cells from their replicon following 3 passages in the presence of either drug <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4C</ref>). In contrast, the combination GS-327073 (5 Â EC <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> ) and VX-950 (5 Â EC 50 ) resulted in clearance of Huh 9-13 cells from their replicon following one passage, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4A)</ref>. Combination of GS-327073 (20 Â EC 50 ) with either 100 IU/ml IFNa 2b <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4D-F)</ref> or with 2 0 -CMeCyt (20 Â EC 50 ) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4G-I</ref>) resulted in clearance of replicon RNA following 2 passages under the combined compound pressure ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4E and H)</ref>. Neither 2 0 -C-MeCyt nor GS-327073 alone (each at 20 Â EC 50 ) resulted in clearance, whereas IFNa 2b did so after 3 passages. Furthermore, replicon-containing Huh 9-13 cells surviving rebound conditions (i.e. addition of G418) following GS-327073 or 2 0 -C-MeCyt treatment did not contain drug resistant replicon (data not shown). In addition, the clearance capacity of the combination of 10 Â EC 50 of GS-327073 and 10 Â EC 50 of 2 0 -C-MeCyt was compared to that of 20 Â EC 50 of either compounds <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4G-I)</ref>. Clearance of replicon from Huh 9-13 cells was observed after 3 passages with the combination at 10 Â EC 50 , whereas either compound alone failed to achieve clearance at 20 Â EC 50 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Stability and predicted hepatic clearance</head><p>Both in basic (pH 7.3) and in acidic solutions (pH 2.2) GS-327073 remained stable. The NADPH-dependent metabolic stability and predicted hepatic clearance was determined in human, dog and rat hepatic microsomes in vitro according to standard methods. The microsomal half-time for GS-327073 was 236 min in human, 88 min in dog and 96 min in rat hepatic microsomes. The predicted hepatic clearance of GS-327073 was 0.15 L/h/kg in human, 0.36 L/h/kg in dog and 0.63 L/h/kg in rat microsomes. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>We recently reported the anti-pestivirus activity of a novel class of imidazopyridines initially devoid of anti-HCV activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Introduction of a fluorine at position 2 of the phenyl group of the lead compound resulted in compounds with in vitro anti-HCV activity. Further optimization resulted in the discovery of 2-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-5-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]-pyridine that inhibited HCV replication with an EC 50 of about 100 nM <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>.</p><p>A series of broader modifications to the 5-benzyl group of the substituted 5-benzyl-2-phenyl-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridines was performed. This resulted in a series of molecules with highly potent anti-HCV activity. Within this series, GS-327073 <ref type="bibr">[5-[[3-(4-</ref> <ref type="bibr">[4, 5-c]</ref>pyridine], was selected for further characterization. GS-327073 proved particularly effective against genotype 1b replicons (the system used to optimize for antiviral potency) with EC 50 values in the low nanomolar range. GS-327073 also inhibited the replication of a genotype 2a cell culture infectious HCVcc (J6/JFHRluc-FLAG), but did so less efficiently than for the genotype 1b replicon. The anti-HCV activity of GS-327073 was compared to that of other HCV inhibitors, including ribavirin, the NS3 protease inhibitors BILN-2061, VX-950 and SCH 503034, the nucleoside NS5B polymerase inhibitors 2 0 -C-MeCyt and 4 0 -azidocytidine and the non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase benzothiadiazine inhibitor GSK-4. The anti-HCV activity of GS-327073 was superior to that of any of these compounds. GS-327073 retained wild-type antiviral activity against a panel of replicons resistant to various HCV inhibitors, including protease, nucleoside and non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors. Remarkably, GS-327073 retained a significant antiviral activity against the pestivirus BVDV. GS-327073 proved also cross-resistant in anti-BVDV assay with BPIP, one of the parent compounds in this class of compounds with potent anti-pestivirus activity but no anti-HCV activity. BPIP was shown to target the fingertip of the pestivirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. It is remarkable that a given non-nucleoside analogue (such as GS-327073) is able to inhibit both pestiviruses and HCV. Representatives of the imidazopyridines are, to the best of our knowledge, the first class of non-nucleoside molecules that are able to inhibit the replication of both pestiand hepaciviruses, albeit potentially different mechanisms of action may be involved. Detailed studies on the molecular mechanism of action of the imidazopyridines will be reported elsewhere. Replicons resistant to GS-327073 were generated following several months of selective in vitro pressure (data not shown). In comparison to several other STAT-C inhibitors, the genetic barrier to achieve high levels of resistance of GS-327073 is relatively high. This might be explained by the fact that three mutations are required in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene to achieve 50-fold or more resistance.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">chlorophenyl)-5- isoxazolyl]methyl]-2-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-5H-imidazo</formula><p>It is likely that specifically targeted antiviral therapy compounds (STAT-C), in the initial years after they become available for the treatment of HCV infected patients, will be combined with the current standard therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. At a later stage, two or more potent STAT-C inhibitors with different resistance profiles, may hopefully be combined without further need for interferon and/or ribavirin. It is hence important to obtain information about the antiviral efficacy of particular combinations. For this reason we studied the antiviral activity of GS-327073 when combined with other classes of HCV inhibitors. To this end, two different assay systems were employed. In a first assay, the combined antiviral activity was evaluated in regular antiviral assays, i.e. with a read-out after 3 days of incubation of the replicon containing cells with the antiviral drug(s). All combinations studied resulted in an overall additive antiviral activity, which was in line with our expectation that compounds that do (likely) not interfere with each others' metabolism or mechanism of action should result in an additive antiviral effect. Combinations of compounds that interfere with each others' biological activity may either result in a synergistic or antagonistic antiviral activity. For example, the IMP-dehydrogenase inhibitor ribavirin is able to potentiate the antiherpes and anti-HBV activity of purine based deoxynucleoside analogues on one hand, but results in an antagonistic effect on HIV and HCV replication when combined with pyrimidine ribonucleoside analogues <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Particular interference of ribavirin with the purine and pyrimidine metabolism is an explanation for these observations. No such antagonistic or synergistic activities were noted when GS-327073 was combined with other selective inhibitors of HCV replication. However, a short antiviral assay may not necessarily predict the antiviral effect of either single compounds or combinations thereof. We, therefore, studied the anti-HCV activity of GS-327073 alone or in combination with either interferon a, a protease or a polymerase HCV inhibitor in ''clearance rebound" assays. Replicon containing cells were cultured for one or more passages in the presence of the antiviral drug(s) and in the absence of the selection marker geneticin. Neither drug, at concentrations that were 5-to 20-fold higher than their EC <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> values, was able to achieve clearance (except for 3 passages in the presence of 100 IU of interferon a). Surprisingly, and despite the fact that no synergistic activity was noted in a regular 3 day antiviral assay, all GS-327073 containing combinations (5Â, 10Â and 20 Â EC 50 ) efficiently cleared cells from their replicon. Clearance-rebound experiments may possibly have predictive value for estimating the potential of drugs (or combinations thereof) to clear liver cells from replicating virus. Combinations of imidazopyridines with various STAT-C inhibitors (or interferon) may have the potential to achieve rapid viral clearance. Our data also indicate that regular short term antiviral combination assays (in replicon based systems) may not necessarily predict synergistic antiviral effects following long-term culture.</p><p>In conclusion, following lead optimization, a series of highly potent HCV inhibitors were developed of which GS-327073 can be considered as a prototype. GS-327073 exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties in vitro. Interestingly, several compounds in this series are active against both HCV and pestiviruses. It is currently being studied whether a common mechanism is responsible for both antiviral activities or whether the precise molecular mechanism of action of anti-HCV or anti-pestivirus activity differs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
